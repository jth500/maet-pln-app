0,"The EU directive aims to protect users from any damaging side-effects that can arise from taking unsuitable medicines.
Only high quality, long-established and scientifically safe herbal medicines will be sold over the counter.
Some traders who sell products imported from outside the EU say their business will be hit.
Herbal medicines - with names such as Cascara Bark and Horny Goat Weed - have become popular.
But from the first of May an EU directive will be enforced, under which all such products must be licensed, following fears that some products could cause harm.
Producers and independent health store owners say the directive, passed in 2004, is draconian and skewed in favour of the largest European manufacturers.
Selwyn Soe runs The Herbal Factory, a contract manufacturer of herbal remedies in Croydon, south London. He believes smaller firms like his own will be squeezed out altogether.
""Unfortunately it looks as if we will have to close down because of this legislation,"" he said.
""The problem for us is that although we would have to pay many thousands of pounds for a licence to keep making each product, unlike a drug company we would not have a licence to make that product exclusively. It just will not be worth paying out the money.""
The Maple Leaf Pharmacy in Twickenham, west London, specialises in alternative and holistic medicine alongside its conventional chemist business.
Owner Galen Rosenberg estimates that about 20% of the health products sold in his pharmacy will simply vanish off the shelves.  In some health food shops a far larger percentage of existing lines are likely to be outlawed.
Mr Rosenberg said he welcomed improved labelling, indicating side-effects, but said the rest of the directive was over the top.
""For instance, we have something which we recommend for hot flushes during menopause. The results have been excellent, but from April I will not be able to order these products in, because the producing company is not large and will not be able to afford the hundreds of thousands of pounds needed to invest for the new regulations,"" he said.
""The new rules are very much in favour of large companies. It is the loss of freedom of choice which worries me. We also expect massive price increases because of the cost of compliance.""
However, the regulator of all these pills and potions says the aim is to protect consumers, not to pick off small suppliers.
Richard Woodfield, of the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, also rejects any suggestions that the legislation is draconian.
""What regulation does is to ensure products meet assured standards. Although the standards are challenging, they are achievable and manageable,"" he said.
""We already have 24 different companies regulating under the scheme and they are certainly not all large companies.""
Yet a leading medicines specialist says he fears the consumer may not be much wiser come May this year.
Professor David Colquhoun, professor of pharmacology at University College London, said the changes were of limited value because the rules did not require makers to show any evidence of whether the newly licensed products were effective.
There are fears that people determined to keep taking their favourite herbs may go online and choose to buy them from merchants who may be careless about quality or potency.
The EU insists that in future, only high quality, long established and scientifically safe herbal medicines can be sold over the counter. But the label still will not be able to tell customers if they can be shown to work.",Hundreds of traditional and imported remedies on the shelves of health food shops and herbalists are set to be banned under new licensing rules.,12196371

2,"If you are Ben Gomes, Google's Tanzania-born, India-bred, US-educated vice-president of search, you are responsible for helping to answer all of them - in the shortest time possible, on all devices: desktops, tablets, phones. And now, in the spoken word too.
Search is Google's raison d'etre and cash cow, bringing in a bulk of its $50bn (Â£33bn) revenues last year. It is also, says Mr Gomes, ""about having a continuous conversation with the user to find out what he wants"".
For a change, we are having a conversation with Mr Gomes, the boy-like 45-year-old guru of search in Googleplex, the funky low-slung company headquarters set in the manicured greens of Mountain View, California.
Mr Gomes works out of an untidy cubicle with four other top engineers in Building 43, the Mecca of search. There are papers strewn around, a headphone lies idly on his table and numbers are scribbled on a whiteboard.
Wrapped around the thin walls near his standing workstation are posters of Russian abstract artist Wassily Kandinsky's work.
From his modest lair, Mr Gomes and his team work relentlessly on their fine-tooth comb search of the worldwide web to serve up the popular search engine, which is now a part of our everyday lives.
""When I joined Google in 1999, search was about basically finding the words that you search for in a document. Then we took this view that we were going to understand what you want and give you what you need,"" he says.
Today, crawling through more than 20 billion pages a day on the continuously expanding world wide web, Mr Gomes and his army of search - a substantial number of the company's 44,000 employees - use algorithms in an attempt to make search intuitive, multimedia and super smart.
The ""maths that computers use to decide stuff"" - as algorithm expert Kevin Slavin called it once - helps rank pages in order of their importance, identifies spelling errors, provides alternatives to words, predicting auto-complete queries, and does unified searches using images, audio and video and voice.
They also try to delve into the deeper meaning of words searched for - ""less 'searchese' and more natural language"", as one employee tells me - and recognises words with similar meanings.
And then, with a hint of understated pride, Mr Gomes talks animatedly about Knowledge Graph, a new function launched last year to make the site's algorithms ""act more human"" in an attempt to offer instant answers to search questions. Time magazine called it the ""next frontier for search"".
""It's a database of all things in the world. It pulls together different databases and unifies them into a single coherent one that has about 500 to 600 million people, places and things in them and about 18 billion attributes and connections between those things,"" he says.
But some sceptics like independent technology columnist Mala Bhargava believe there are some pitfalls.
""Google does a great job of evolving search continuously, slipping in new features all the time. But innovation always walks a tightrope between being useful, even prescient, and being so excessively personalised and targeted as to be meaningless,"" she says.
But folks at Google believe the fact that it handles a mind-boggling 100-billion plus searches every month, or over three billion a day is testimony to its popularity. A good 15% of the search questions it sees every day are new - queries it has never answered before.
Then there's the giddy speed of search.
When Mr Gomes joined Google in 1999 after a stint in Sun Microsystems working on Java programming language, some searches could take up to 20 seconds. When I keyed in Ben Gomes on Google recently it spat out 19,000,000 results in .28 seconds.  (Most of the top ranked results were about the search guru himself.)
Chemical interest
What the search on Mr Gomes possibly will not tell you is that as a young boy growing up in Bangalore, he was more fascinated with chemistry than computers in the beginning.
So much so, he recounts, that one day he picked up some sulphuric acid from a city shop, and walked into his school, ""swinging the bottle in my hand, so happy"".
But then he went to a school with classmates like Krishna Bharat, a computer fiend who later become the man behind Google news, and which counted Sabeer Bhatia, founder of Hotmail, among its students.
So when his brother bought him a small microcomputer in 1983, young Ben joined a small bunch of people interested in machines in what then still was a technophobic country.
Mr Gomes, son of a car distributor father and a school teacher mother, moved to the US 25 years ago. He went to Berkeley, where he picked up a PhD in computer science.
And then the internet happened.
It was about that time his classmate Krishna Bharat told Mr Gomes about Google, and he joined this relatively unknown company ""because it would make this content available to the world through a really good search"".
The rest is search history.
Presidential search
What is the next frontier of search, I ask Mr Gomes, before heading for a meal at the Indian curry station at Googleplex.
""Now search is becoming mobile - on phones and tablets. The challenge is that it is on a small screen, so it's hard to type. The opportunity is that it's got a really good microphone and a touch screen.
""It can enable a new kind of interface. So we realised we want to build an interface that was much like the way you talk to some person and ask a question,"" he says.
â€¢ Suggest your Digital Indians
And then, with a gleam in his eyes, Mr Gomes picks up his HTC smartphone and barks a series of questions into the Google search app.
""Who is the president of India?"" he asks.
""Pranab Mukherjee,"" promptly answers a woman's voice.
""How old is he?"" Mr Gomes prods on.
""He is 77 years old,"" she answers, loud and clear.
""This is cool isn't it?"" says Mr Gomes.
""And it's going to get better and more intelligent.""",What do you do if you get more than three billion queries a day?,23866614
3,"Canada has revoked his citizenship three times since 1995 but each time it has been overturned on appeal, the latest ruling being made on Thursday.
Helmut Oberlander says he was forced to act as a translator for the WWII squad.
He says he did not participate in atrocities and was conscripted.
The Supreme Court in Ottawa on Thursday ruled that the Canadian government must prove he was a willing participant in the eastern Europe death squad in order to deport him from the country.
It said that it was not prepared to hear the federal government's appeal against a lower court's ruling that the government should reconsider its decision to revoke Oberlander's citizenship.
Oberlander was born in Ukraine and became a member of a Nazi death squad, the Ek 10a, which operated behind the German army's front line in occupied eastern European territory between 1941 to 1943.
It was part of a force that killed more than two million people, many of them Jews, CTV News reported.
Oberlander insists that he was made to do translation work as a teenager and that he would have been executed if he refused to do so.
His responsibilities included finding food and cleaning boots before he later became an infantryman in the German army.
Oberlander emigrated to Canada in 1954, becoming a citizen in 1960 - but did not reveal his wartime record.
One of his lawyers said he was pleased by the Supreme Court's ruling.
""It's taken a great toll on his family. Over and over again the courts have exonerated him,"" Ronald Poulton told Reuters.
""It's been tiring and difficult and unnecessary and now the Supreme Court - the highest court - has told the government that's enough.""
Mr Poulton argues that while Oberlander concealed his wartime service, this should not result in him losing his citizenship after living for 50 years in Canada, especially as he had neither carried out nor been complicit in war crimes.
But Jewish groups say Mr Oberlander ""lied about his complicity in these atrocities and gained Canadian citizenship fraudulently"".
They argue he should be ""deported without further delay"".

5,"Experts have linked the text on both the front and back to themes in the author's novel Mansfield Park.
The fragment was stuck to a letter discovered in a first edition of her memoirs, written by her nephew, James Edward Austen-Leigh.
The revealed text is part of a sermon apparently composed by her brother, the Reverend James Austen in 1814.
The book and letter, written by Jane Austen's nephew in 1870, had been held in a private collection but was recently bought for an undisclosed sum by the Jane Austen museum in Chawton, Hampshire.
Very few examples of Jane Austen's handwriting survive - there are no manuscripts of her famous books and many of her letters were destroyed after her death.
A team at West Dean College near Chichester, West Sussex, succeeded in unsticking the fragment, allowing the previously unseen writing on the back to be deciphered.
It reads: ""...great propriety preserved - Wherever... wanted to be cleared of the Superstitious... of Popery... or whenever new ones were to be... composed in order to fill up & connect the Services... with a true spirit.""
While the front of the fragment reads: ""Men may get into a habit of repeating the words of our Prayers by rote, perhaps without thoroughly understanding - certainly without thoroughly feeling their full force and meaning.""
Experts claim the text echoes a passage in Mansfield Park which was also published in 1814 - a few months before the sermon text was written.
They say it reflects a discussion in the novel on the ""art of reading"" and its importance to the modern clergyman.
Jane Austen's eldest brother, James, was rector at the church of St Nicholas in Steventon, and she would travel there to stay with him.
Historians believe she helped copy out his sermons for him.
Mary Guyatt, museum curator, said: ""What we have to go on is the nephew's transcription.
""He's cut up the sermon in around 1817 and he's written underneath it 'this is the writing but not the words of the author Jane Austen, my aunt.'
""He's very clear that it was his father's composition.""
But Prof Kathryn Sutherland, of St Anne's College, Oxford, said it showed earlier drafts of Mansfield Park at least influenced her brother.
""The scrap raises the possibility that the novel inspired James's sermon and even demonstrates the cross-fertilization between Jane Austen's creative writing and the wider life of her family.""
Historians will now study the note for clues to whether the sermon may after all have been written by Jane Austen.
It will go on display at the museum later this year.","A handwritten note by Jane Austen ""hidden"" for 150 years on the back of a fragment of paper has been revealed.",27489222

Media playback is not supported on this device
But Van Persie attributed the emphatic win to the tactics of Van Gaal, his new manager at Manchester United.
""This is definitely down to him,"" said the 30-year-old.
Spain, who are also the European champions, were humiliated as the Netherlands came from behind to thrash their opponents.
Van Persie cancelled out Xabi Alonso's penalty with a sublime header before goals by Bayern Munich's Robben and Feyenoord defender De Vrij made it 3-1.
Two goals in the space of eight minutes by Van Persie and Robben completed Spain's embarrassment.
""If you see how he prepared us, and how he predicted the game would go, and you see how it went - unbelievable,"" added Van Persie about Van Gaal.
""For the whole Netherlands, this is a dream come true.''
Van Gaal, who will take over at Old Trafford after the tournament, was delighted with his team's win.
""The Netherlands were sensational.  It should have been seven or eight. Some of the performances - Arjen Robben, Robin van Persie and Daley Blind down that wing, they were absolutely brilliant. I have never seen that Spain back four pulled around as much as they were.""
The 62-year-old returned Van Persie's compliment, praising the striker along with the rest of the side.
""With strikers like Van Persie, Robben and Wesley Sneijder behind them, things like this can happen,'' he said.
Van Gaal's side face Australia next on 18 June in Porto Alegre and the former Barcelona boss urged caution despite getting their campaign off to a flying start.
""We don't have anything yet,"" he added. ""We've made a pretty start. If you beat Australia [on Wednesday], then you've made a good start.''

7,"The sanction was imposed after the club had failed to pay disciplinary fees for making undisclosed payments to players.
The club appealed the IFA Disciplinary Committee decision and hearing is set for the week commencing 15 August.
Portadown's league opener at Coleraine on Saturday could have gone ahead but NIFL said the match remains off.
The Northern Ireland Football League's Premiership Committee added that the decision not to play the game was taken in the best interests of the league.
If the match was allowed to take place, and Portadown's suspension was subsequently reimposed, it could mean the result would be void.
The match will now only be played if Portadown's appeal is successful - if not Coleraine will be awarded the three points.
The fine has now been paid but the IFA Disciplinary Committee did not exercise their discretion to lift the ban at a meeting on Wednesday night.
""Having considered points made by Portadown FC, and taking into account Article 9.3 of the Irish FA's Disciplinary Code as well as being cognisant of Portadown's Premiership game against Coleraine scheduled for this Saturday, they were not persuaded to exercise discretion in this case,"" said the IFA following Wednesday's meeting.
""The decision means the suspension, which came into effect on Thursday 28th July, will remain in place until the Monday after any payment is made - in accordance with Article 9.3 of the Irish FA's Disciplinary Code.""
A fine of £5,000 was handed down in April and it is understood that an initial cheque sent to the IFA 'bounced'.
The fine was imposed, along with a transfer embargo preventing the club from signing players on professional terms until June 2017, after irregularities were found in payments made to former striker Gary Twigg.

The church tweeted ""Archbishop of Wales offers a pastoral letter on same-sex relationships apologising unreservedly for prejudice within the church.""
Last year, Dr Morgan said it would be ""foolish"" to bring forward a bill for same-sex marriages in church.
A statement released by the church said although it was not ready to allow or bless same-sex marriages, ""the debate is not over"".
It went on to apologise for ""the persecution and mistreatment [gay people] have endured at the hands of the Church"".
Dr Morgan also authorised prayers which can be said with same-sex couples following a celebration, but they fall short of a church blessing for civil partnerships and marriages.
However, Welsh Anglican bishops ruled out a change in the law to allow same-sex couples to get married in church.
Dr Morgan told the meeting there was concern the issue might tear the church apart.
Last year, an informal consultation showed a small majority of bishops, clergy and lay members in favour of change, but it was nowhere near the two thirds of the governing body needed.
Bishops will send a copy of the pastoral letter to all clergy, explaining their position.

9,"Ben Butler, 36, denies murdering his daughter Ellie by causing the ""catastrophic"" injuries.
She may have fallen and hit her head as she watched the popular children's cartoon, the Old Bailey heard.
The pathologist who carried out the post-mortem test said he had never seen someone die from similar injuries.
During his cross-examination of Prof Anthony Risdon, Mr Butler's defence counsel Icah Peart QC said Ellie had been a fan of the cartoon, and there were ""Peppa Pig artefacts about her room"".
He asked the pathologist if he knew a rhyme from the show, where Peppa jumps and falls from a bed.
""What I am talking about is someone jumping up and down on the bed and, as Peppa Pig does, jumps over backwards, falls down and hits her head on the concrete floor,"" he said.
Mr Peart QC then asked Prof Risdon if such momentum may have resulted in Ellie's injuries.
He replied: ""I have seen a large number of head injuries in children.
""I have never come across a scenario like that and I have never come across a short distance fall that results in a similar injury.""
He said Ellie died from a ""considerable blunt impact to the head"" and not from a short fall from a stool or chair.
There was a ""strong possibility"" that four marks on her jaw were caused by ""gripping"", he added.
Earlier, Prof Risdon told jurors he had not been influenced by a colleague who had suggested Ellie was killed by her parents.
Jurors have been told Mr Butler had previously been convicted of assaulting Ellie when she was a baby, but was cleared on appeal.
She was returned home 11 months before her death in October 2013.
The jury also heard from consultant neuroradiologist Neil Stoodley, who told Mr Butler's 2007 trial at Croydon Crown Court Ellie, then a baby, had suffered injuries as a result of being shaken.
He also reiterated his findings at the Court of Appeal in 2012, following which Ellie was returned to her parent's custody.
Challenging the doctor on his earlier evidence, Mr Peart asked whether Mr Stoodley thought his previous diagnosis was ""incorrect"".
The consultant replied: ""No, not on the basis of the evidence as I understand it.""
On Tuesday, jurors heard that Ellie had suffered four distinct periods of injuries.
Skeletal pathology expert Professor Anthony Freemont said a healed skull fracture could have dated back to the first allegation of assault by Mr Butler in 2007.
Three to five weeks before her death, Ellie suffered a broken shoulder bone.
Then she sustained ""bruising"" to the skull, two to three weeks before the fatal injury, the court heard.
Consultant orthopaedic surgeon Michael Uglow said Ellie would have been in ""acute pain"" which she would not have been able to hide for 10 days after her shoulder was broken.
Mr Butler, from Sutton, south-west London, also denies child cruelty.
Her mother Jennie Gray, 36, denies child cruelty but has admitted perverting the course of justice over allegations she destroyed evidence and lied to police to protect her partner.

The move would need approval from Super League clubs and the Rugby Football League (RFL).
""The clubs were broadly supportive of his ideas subject to gaining more details,"" said an RFL spokesman.
The RFL scrapped the traditional mid-season Test against France following a series of one-sided scores with the last one played in 2010 when England won 60-6.

11,"Work has also ended on versions of its software that was designed to run on smartphones and laptops.
Ubuntu said it took the decision because the project had failed to win over users and industry partners.
Instead, it said, it would concentrate on code for cloud services and internet-of-things devices.
The Linux open source operating system exists in lots of different versions or ""distributions"" that share the same source code but often have a different interface laid on top. Unity aimed to be a graphical front-end suitable for lots of different devices.
Canonical, which makes the popular Ubuntu distribution of the Linux open source software, started the Unity project in 2011. The ultimate idea was to produce software that ran on large and small devices and could be used the same way on all of them.
The Unity project also aimed to let smartphones act as a desktop machine when combined with other devices such as docking stations.
However, said Canonical boss Mark Shuttleworth in a blog, although Unity tried to end some of the fragmentation in the open source world it actually ended up contributing to it.
In addition, he said, few people had bought phones or laptops that ran the Ubuntu/Unity combination and few laptop makers were offering the software as an option.
Mr Shuttleworth said that Ubuntu would switch back to the default user interface for Linux - known as Gnome - in April 2018.
He said the decision to end Unity had been ""very difficult"" because he believed strongly in ways to make it easier to use Linux anywhere and everywhere and because of the time he had spent with the developers working on it.

13,"The decision sent global financial markets into a spin and saw the pound plunge to its lowest level in more than 30 years, as investors bet that the UK economy would suffer.
The FTSE 100 share index of the UK's 100 biggest companies has since bounced back, but the pound is still down at levels last seen in the 1980s.
Now we have a deadline for when the formal Brexit talks will start - the end of March 2017 - the pound has fallen back to the lows it hit in the days after the 23 June vote.
The companies whose shares have fared best since referendum day are those which make most of their money in other currencies and are less exposed to the UK economy.
So who have the markets judged to be the biggest winners and losers so far?
In the days after the referendum result, many investors started looking at FTSE 100 companies with large businesses outside the UK.
British fashion designer Burberry, which generates about 85% of its sales abroad, was one.
Even though the company warned staff it would be stronger inside the EU, its share price has shot up 24% since 23 June, adding more than £2bn to its market value and making it one of the biggest winners on the index.
Burberry is in the ""sweet spot"" for UK companies, says Laith Khalaf, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.
Because of the pound's fall, the money Burberry makes abroad in dollars, euros and yen is worth more back in the UK, and the costs in its UK head office are relatively lower, he says.
The iconic trench coat maker could also benefit from more Asian tourists bargain-hunting in the UK after the pound's fall.
""Chinese tourists are very savvy in their understanding of global foreign exchange rates,"" says an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, although he adds that more visitors to Burberry's UK shops could come at the expense of sales in other regions.
Like all companies on the FTSE 100, Burberry's shares have also been affected by non-Brexit issues, including a boost from last month's London Fashion Week and poaching a new chief executive from Céline.
Banking giant HSBC was also critical of the idea of leaving the EU, but since the referendum has seen its shares surge, by around 27%.
The bank - the UK's second biggest company - earns about three quarters of its profits in Asia, according to Mr Khalaf, which could explain why investors think, as with Burberry, the weaker pound will boost its prospects.
Shares in more UK-focused banks Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland have dropped 24% and 29% respectively.
The recent shift in UK interest rates will also have played a part. Lower rates make it harder for banks to make a profit but that's less of a problem for HSBC with its large overseas interests, than it is for the domestic banks.
Ian Gordon, a banking analyst at Investec, says most of HSBC's business is outside the UK, including the US, where interest rates are forecast to rise.
Royal Bank of Scotland, in comparison, is an ""almost pure UK business and 'lower for longer' interest rates is a UK phenomenon,"" he says.
Also working in HSBC's favour, Mr Gordon adds, is that the bank is handing back $2.5bn (£1.9bn) to shareholders this year after it sold its Brazilian business.
The biggest winners, though? Mining companies. Something of a surprise for investors after the industry's volatility in the last 12 months.
Edward Sterck, a metals and mining analyst at BMO Capital Markets, says: ""This time last year mining investors were feeling pretty negative, and in January many were feeling very negative indeed.
""Sitting here today they are pretty buoyant.""
Mexican gold and silver miner Fresnillo's shares have risen 46%, putting it top of the post-Brexit leaderboard. Swiss mining trader Glencore is up 39% and British miner Anglo American has also gained 39%.
The companies' large foreign earnings, as well as rising metal prices, have helped turn around their fortunes.
Gold and silver have increased 6% and 12% respectively since the referendum. Seen as ""safe haven"" assets, they have been boosted by uncertainty in global financial markets and rock-bottom interest rates, two issues further intensified by the Brexit vote.
At the other end of the scale, the biggest loser on the blue chip index has been budget airline Easyjet.
Its shares are still down more than 34%, leaving the Luton-based firm in danger of being relegated from the FTSE 100.
Stephen Furlong, an analyst at Davy, says its shares haven't recovered since warning shortly after the Brexit vote that the weaker pound would put off some UK holidaymakers and would make fuel - which it pays for in dollars - more expensive.
""The share price has taken a hammering and there's still a lot of uncertainty,"" Mr Furlong says.
Analysts at Barclays estimate that factors outside the airline's control, such as terror attacks, strikes in France and congestion at Gatwick, will cost Easyjet at least £150m this year.
Also towards the bottom of the FTSE performance table is British Airways owner IAG, which has seen its shares fall 23% on similar fears about a drop-off in UK travel abroad.
Like airlines and UK banks, housebuilders are seen as the most at risk in the FTSE 100 if the UK economy slows down or enters recession.
Shares in construction companies are down significantly since the referendum, despite lower interest rates, an ongoing housing shortage and schemes like Help to Buy bolstering the property market.
Mr Khalaf says: ""The big elephant in the room is what effect Brexit will have on the economy and will it take its toll on house prices?""
Taylor Wimpey, Barratt Developments and Persimmon, three of the UK's biggest homebuilders, have made back some share price losses, but are still down 20%, 14% and 13% respectively.
More than 100 days on, the market seems settled in its forecasts on construction firms and which other companies will gain and lose in the post-Brexit landscape, says Mr Khalaf.

Dunlop also broke John McGuinness's record of 132.70 when he lapped at 132.75 on his Hawk BMW Superbike.
The pair will start as favourites in Saturday's opening Superbike race.
The breathtaking speeds set in a week of perfect conditions for practice indicate that the first-ever sub 17-minute lap for the circuit could be on the cards.
Dunlop, also riding a BMW, was marginally behind Hutchinson in the Superstocks on 131.88 - that from a standing start.
Yorkshireman Dean Harrison became the fastest Supersport rider of the week when he lapped at 126.25 on his Kawasaki on Friday night.
That speed eclipsed Lee Johnston's previous best for the class of 124.84, set on Thursday evening.

15,"Relegated Hampshire were reinstated ahead of Division Two runners-up Kent.
Kennedy is due to meet Colin Graves, the chairman of the England & Wales Cricket Board, to discuss the matter.
""If you lose confidence in the people you are dealing with, it is quite difficult to continue,"" Kennedy said.
""I feel completely let down by the ECB and I will put forward Kent's case [at the meeting] to see if anything can be done to reverse the situation or give us some comfort that we're not being singled out for all the wrong reasons.
""A lot depends on the answers we get over the next few days, but if I am completely and utterly shouted down I will have to think about if it is worthwhile continuing.""
The issue arose after Durham were relegated on Monday, having accepted a £3.8m financial aid package from the ECB.
Kennedy also expressed displeasure in the manner in which he discovered the ECB's decision not to promote Kent, claiming he found out after being contacted by a journalist.
""The ECB decided to telephone Hampshire and tell them they were staying up and I found out by having a call from a journalist at a national newspaper who asked me what I thought,"" Kennedy told BBC Radio Kent.
""One team were told they were staying up and they ignored the team that lost the battle but I haven't given up by any means.

17,"The convention allows Irish, Dutch, French, German and Belgian vessels to fish within six and 12 nautical miles of UK coastline.
Environment Secretary Michael Gove said the move would help take back control of fishing access to UK waters.
The European Commission said it ""took note"" but felt the convention had been superseded by EU law.
Ireland's minister for agriculture, food and the marine, Michael Creed, however, said it was ""unwelcome and unhelpful"".
""Brexit poses very serious challenges to the seafood sector and this announcement will form part of the negotiations,"" he said.
The Scottish government backed the idea, saying it had been pressing for it ""for some time"".
The London Fisheries Convention sits alongside the EU Common Fisheries Policy, which allows all European Union countries access between 12 and 200 nautical miles of the UK and sets quotas for how much fish nations can catch.
The relationship between the UK and Ireland is further governed by a separate arrangement.
Withdrawing from the convention, which was signed in 1964 before the UK joined what became the EU, means UK vessels will also lose the right to fish in waters six to 12 nautical miles offshore of the other countries.
What happens to the 12 to 200 mile area will be one of the issues at stake in Brexit negotiations.
Michael Gove told the BBC's Andrew Marr the change was about ""taking back control"" of UK waters, 6-12 miles from the coast.
When the UK left the EU it would become an ""independent coastal state"", he said.
He said the EU's common fisheries policy had been an environmental disaster and the government wanted to change that, upon Brexit, to ensure sustainable fish stocks in future.
But the SNP's Richard Lochhead, who held the post of fisheries minister in Scotland until last year, has concerns around fishing being used as a ""bargaining chip"" by the government, which would ""let down UK fishermen"".
""Michael Gove is doing his best to get maximum publicity out of the easy bit,"" he told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend. ""But the difficult, complex bit is still to come [with] the Common Fisheries Policy.
UKIP's fisheries spokesman Mike Hookem also said he feared another ""wholesale betrayal"" without assurances about the 200-mile zone.
""Fishing communities across Britain voted to leave the EU to get back the rights to earn a living, support their communities and to stop the EU plundering our seas of fish that the UK could exploit economically,"" he said.
He added that the announcement was ""no victory for the fishing community"" and was instead a ""government attempt to use smoke and mirrors to placate British fishermen, while at the same time having the option of handing most our fishing rights to the EU"".
Government figures say fishing contributed Â£604m to UK GDP in 2015 and employed around 12,000 fishers. In 2016, the fish processing industry supported around 18,000 jobs.
The industry's body, the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, welcomed the decision.
Chief executive Barrie Deas said: ""This is welcome news and an important part of establishing the UK as an independent coastal state with sovereignty over its own exclusive economic zone.""
Its chairman Mike Cohen said a 12-mile exclusive zone for UK boats would be ""a good thing"" for the UK's inshore fishing fleet.
Will McCallum, Greenpeace UK head of oceans, said leaving the convention would not in itself deliver a better future for the UK fishing industry, and that for years governments had blamed the EU for their ""failure"" to support the small-scale, sustainable fishers.
He said, for example, that the UK had had the power since 2013 to decide how to allocate its EU fishing quota but that a report by Greenpeace in 2016 had found almost two thirds of that quota was concentrated in the hands of three companies.
He said the UK would also still be bound by the UN convention of the law of the seas - which requires cooperation with neighbours.
But Mr McCallum said he was ""excited"" that the government was making fishing a priority, after fearing fishing communities would end up ""at the bottom of the heap"" amidst complex Brexit negotiations.
Environmental law firm ClientEarth consultant Dr Tom West said the move appeared to be an aggressive negotiating tactic.
""As a country outside the EU we need to consider how we can best co-operate with our neighbours, rather than unilaterally withdrawing from all agreements in the hope that standing alone will make us better.""","The government is to end an arrangement that allows other countries to fish in UK waters, it has been announced.",40471466
18,"The new Rent Smart scheme requires anyone who rents out property in Wales to register or become licensed by 23 November.
But the Residential Landlords Association (RLA) said many were still unaware they need to do so.
Rent Smart Wales said landlords were given a year to register and it would not extend the deadline.
A Freedom of Information request by the RLA showed just 32,230 out of 130,000 landlords had registered by 18 October - those who do not comply can be fined.
The figures were released by Cardiff council, which is administering the scheme for the whole of Wales.
Douglas Haig, RLA director for Wales, said he was writing to Community Secretary Carl Sargeant to request a new deadline to allow time for landlords to be properly educated about what they need to do.
But Rent Smart Wales said there had been a large increase in numbers registering as the deadline approached and 46,300 out of 130,000 landlords had now registered and a further 11,400 had begun the registration process.
Mr Haig said communication had been ""poor"" with ""very few"" landlords aware of the scheme.
He said others were leaving it until the last minute because registration and licences run for five years from the date they are approved, not from 23 November.
The number of staff employed to carry out the scheme had also been ""grossly underestimated"", he added.
""I don't think it's asking a lot for the Welsh Government or Cardiff council to come forth with an education plan to get this information out there. That would be a sensible approach,"" he said.
A Rent Smart Wales spokesman said: ""We have no intention of extending the deadline. However, we do recognise that, due the very high numbers of landlords visiting the website to register and apply for licenses, some are experiencing difficulties.
""The Rent Smart Wales team consists of 79 posts and the team are working hard to reduce waiting times for customers.
""Once the November 23 deadline for complying has passed, enforcement powers will be used in a sensible and proportionate manner.""

19,"The uprising quickly escalated into a civil war between the Syrian government and various rebel factions, killing at least 250,000 and displacing many more.
Similar movements in the region, later called the Arab Spring, led to the ousting of Hosni Mubarak in Egypt, Muammar Gaddafi in Libya and Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali in Tunisia.
Five years on, people across the region have told the BBC how the uprising and the political divisions and economic turmoil that followed have affected their lives.
""I had to leave my pregnant wife behind. It was too dangerous for me to stay,"" says Majdy Al-Kassem, who fled Syria in early 2015 and now lives in the UK.
Majdy studied English literature in his hometown Idlib in north-western Syria when peaceful anti-government protests erupted in 2011. He and fellow students joined the demonstrations.
""In the first six months protesters were not armed, but the security forces started to shoot at people and come to their houses to arrest them,"" he says.
Some of the protests turned into armed insurgency and following violent clashes a brutal and complex civil war broke out across most of the country.
""One of my teachers was killed by a sniper and in the following years a lot of my friends died in prison. I was afraid that somebody who saw me at the demonstration would frame me,"" he says.
Syria: The story of the conflict
UN says peace talks in Geneva are 'moment of truth'
Islamic State group: The full story
Life inside IS: Diaries from Raqqa
A month after Majdy fled, a coalition of Islamist rebel forces, supported by Turkey and Saudi Arabia, seized Idlib from the Syrian government.
""It's a little bit safer now because there is no fighting in the city itself, but your house can always be hit by Russian or Syrian government air strikes. Many houses in our neighbourhood were destroyed.
""My family is in a very bad situation now. They often don't have the most basic things like water, electricity and petrol.""
The rise of the so-called Islamic State and the increasing involvement of foreign powers have further complicated the conflict.
Like many others, Majdy made the dangerous journey across the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece in a rubber dinghy. Walking northwards on the so-called Balkan route, he was imprisoned in Croatia for three months, but eventually made it to the UK last summer.
The authorities in the UK are now processing Majdy's asylum application and he says: ""I hope they let me stay and bring my family.""
The first protests of the Arab Spring started in Tunisia after Mohamed Bouazizi, a street vendor, set himself on fire in the city of Sidi Bouzid in December 2010.
Weeks of demonstrations followed before Tunisia's long-time president Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali fled into exile on 14 January 2011.
""When we went to demonstrate in front of the Ministry of the Interior in Tunis on 14 January, we didn't realise that Ben Ali would be running away by the end of the day,"" says Hisham Ben Khamsa.
""Ben Ali had relied on stifling any kind of expression and dissent. The regime was out of sync with the population. Corruption and unemployment pushed people overboard.""
Tunisia has been called the Arab Spring's ""success story"" by some after a largely peaceful transition to democracy.
In recent years, the country has been hit by a wave of attacks on tourists sites and renewed protests over youth unemployment.
""Economically and in terms of instability, it has been five years of a rollercoaster. But in this chaos and mayhem, there is some stability building up,"" Hisham told the BBC.
Ines Ghaieb, a preparatory school teacher in Tunis, says her life changed for the better after the uprising.
""I lost my job at the school during Ben Ali's time and couldn't do anything about it. Now I have a permanent contract.""
She says that Tunisians can now express their opinions in public and in the media.
""Tunisia was an exception from the beginning. Even if there are problems, I would say the revolution was successful.""
Pictures of tens of thousands of protesters on Cairo's central Tahrir Square went around the world in January and February 2011.
""I'll never experience the same again, the spirit of the people was unbelievable, and we were all on the same page,"" says Mohammed Safi, an Egyptian radio DJ.
""We succeeded in bringing the government down after 18 days, but the biggest mistake was to leave the square because we thought we had won.
Mohamed Morsi, a leading member of the Muslim brotherhood, was elected as president in June 2012, but following mass protests his government was overthrown by the army a year later.
""I think almost the entire nation is suffering from post-traumatic stress,"" Mohammed says.
""I moved out of Cairo three years ago to protect my sanity. The vibe there has become unbearable.
""Five years down the line, many people are extremely sceptictal and frustrated. Almost everybody is suffering economically and the currency has lost a lot of value.""
Human rights activists have reported a rise in the number of people going missing at the hand of the security services.
""The security apparatus is more intense than under Mubarak, but the message to future generations is that you can challenge authority,"" says Mohammed.
""In the early months of 2011, not a lot of Libyans thought the protests would spread from Tunisia to Libya because the former regime of Muammar Gaddafi had a tight grip on society,"" says Muhanned Kalash, an up-and-coming Libyan actor.
""When the protests started in Benghazi, we couldn't do much in Tripoli, but of course we followed the events very closely.""
Fierce fighting broke out between rebels in the east of the country and government forces. In August 2011, rebel militia toppled Gaddafi and took over Tripoli, helped by international airstrikes.
Muhanned says that five years on, none of the revolution's goals have been achieved.
""It's close to impossible for me to save money, to marry, to travel to different cities or even to go out at night because there is a risk we might get carjacked.""
Libya has had two rival governments since 2014.
The political and security vacuum in the country has helped the so-called Islamic State group to establish a foothold.
Muhanned says security is his biggest concern at the moment: ""With Daesh [IS], it's like we see a storm approaching, but we're pretending we are not scared.
""It's shocking to see how OK Libyans have become with death.""",It is five years since peaceful protests against Syria's President Bashar al-Assad started in Damascus.,35718798

22,"Victory was Reading's first in WSL 1, leaving the Belles nine points adrift at the bottom with five games to play.
Reading led through Emma Follis and Nia Jones before a fine Emily Simpkins hit gave the hosts hope after half-time.
But Follis curled in her second before Rachel Rowe made it 4-1 on 84 minutes.
The win meant Reading moved above Notts County and Sunderland - who both play on Sunday - into sixth place, with all three sides level on nine points.
The pace and skill of Follis carved open plenty of chances for the Royals, but she had to be withdrawn in the latter stages because of an injury.
Follis and Jones both tucked in from close range as the visitors enjoyed the better of the first half.
Simpkins had given the Belles belief straight at the start of the second half and she almost levelled soon afterwards in their best spell, but her free-tick was tipped over the bar by Mary Earps.

""It's been a long time coming - we probably deserved it slightly sooner. But to win 4-1 in that manner is just brilliant.

23,"The charity Antibiotic Research UK, which compiled the data for the BBC, said the surge could not be explained by extra bacterial infections.
It said it was probably due to doctors handing out pills for colds and flu.
Experts said an acceptable prescribing level was still unclear.
There is a noticeable winter cold and flu season, when the viruses find it easier to spread.
Some bacterial infections are also more common in the winter - such as pneumonia, partly as a result of secondary infections in people whose lungs have been damaged by viral infections.
But others, such as urinary tract infections, are actually more common in summer.
Prof Colin Garner, of Antibiotic Research UK, told the BBC News website: ""You would expect bacterial infections to possibly go up in winter.
""But they don't go up as dramatically as the heat map shows - 50% more in December compared to August.
""So the map reflects, in all probability, an over-prescribing of antibiotics at that time of year.""
Prof Garner said 97% of patients who asked for an antibiotic were given one.
But he said doctors were often ""caught between a rock and hard place"" as it could be safer to give antibiotics if it was not clear whether the patient had a viral or bacterial infection.
The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence has argued that 10 million antibiotic prescriptions are inappropriate each year.
The concern is that high levels of antibiotic use are leading to bacteria developing resistance to the drugs and becoming untreatable.
Prof Mike Sharland, a Department of Health adviser on antibiotics, said the summer-winter difference was ""recognised as a global problem"".
However, he said it was impossible to say at the moment how many of those winter prescriptions were genuinely inappropriate.
He told the BBC: ""Obviously this is important, interesting data, but what we now need to do is identify more clearly what is appropriate and what is less appropriate seasonal variation.""
Meanwhile, Antibiotic Research UK in collaboration with the data analysis company Exasol has also published maps showing a stark regional variation in antibiotic prescribing so far this year.
It shows that 21% fewer antibiotics are prescribed in London than in the north of England.
Deprived coastal towns, such as Skegness in Lincolnshire, also have high levels of antibiotic prescription.
Prof Garner added: ""It's a problem because if we don't tackle it then medicine as we currently practise it will not be practised as we're so reliant on antibiotics.""
Cancer therapy, surgery and organ transplants are all reliant on antibiotics.
Meanwhile a report by the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that few people understand antibiotic resistance despite its clear threat to global health.
It polled 10,000 people across 12 countries - Barbados, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, the Russian Federation, Serbia, South Africa, Sudan and Vietnam.
Most wrongly thought it was people rather than bacteria that develop resistance to antibiotics.
Nearly half of people surveyed thought resistance was only a problem for people taking antibiotics regularly while in fact anyone can contract an antibiotic-resistant infection.
Dr Keiji Fukuda, from the WHO, said: ""The findings of this survey point to the urgent need to improve understanding around antibiotic resistance.
""One of the biggest health challenges of the 21st Century will require global behaviour change by individuals and societies.""

Earlier detectives suggested two people had been found, but later confirmed searches are continuing.
Miss O'Callaghan, 22, was last seen leaving Suju nightclub in Swindon on Saturday.

Later in the afternoon police vans arrived at a house in Ashbury Avenue, Swindon, and a white tent was put up in the front garden.
Officers are searching inside and outside the property and removing items to a nearby van.
Detectives are also searching a second location between Ashbury and Letcombe Regis, some seven miles east of Swindon and close to the Uffington White Horse, in Oxfordshire.
An area of the road and the verge has been sealed-off and is being guarded by a number of police officers.
Angus Tucker, the landlord at the Blowing Stone pub in Kingston Lisle, some five miles east of Ashbury, said customers had told him a section of the B4507 was cordoned off.

Babett Peter headed into her own net after the break to level the score, but substitute Caroline Graham Hansen's low finish gave the visitors victory.
Chelsea must now score at least twice in Germany on 18 November.
The new Women's Super League champions made a nervy start and conceded an early goal when they failed to clear a free-kick and Nilla Fischer's poked shot was deflected in by England left-back Rafferty.
Chelsea defender Gilly Flaherty then appeared to elbow Vanessa Bernauer on the half-hour mark, as Wolfsburg frustrated the hosts by pressing high up the pitch.
The Blues drew level after half-time through Peter's own goal and almost took the lead when Ji So-yun's shot was blocked and Fran Kirby fired narrowly wide.
However, Hansen's goal put Wolfsburg - who have reached the semi-finals in each of the past three seasons - in control.

""Four weeks between games showed in the first 45 minutes so I hope our Football Association do more to prepare better scheduling because if an English team is going to win the Champions League, we have to be more game ready.

""It took us a while to get started, and it was a poor goal to concede. Other than that there wasn't a lot between the two teams. The difference at this level is that we had two glorious chances to score and didn't and they counter us and go 2-1 up.

30,"The one-time IRA commander went from the riots of the Bogside in Londonderry during the 1970s, to the very heart of government.
He became one of Sinn Féin's two ministers in the first power-sharing deal that followed the Good Friday Agreement.
In the Stormont Assembly election of May 2007, he was elected deputy first minister, with the Democratic Unionist Party leader Ian Paisley as first minister.
Many people were surprised at how well the two leaders appeared to get on.
They were labelled the ""Chuckle Brothers"" as a result of being frequently photographed laughing and smiling together.
Martin McGuinness stood down temporarily as deputy first minister to contest the Irish presidential election in 2011, when his IRA past received much attention in the media.
He came third in the election in which he was the only candidate who, as a non-resident, was ineligible to vote.
In 2008, he went to Baghdad to share his knowledge of peace-making.
In recent years, Martin McGuinness insisted his job had become a political one.
""My war is over. My job as a political leader is to prevent that war and I feel very passionate about it,"" he said.
""I want to build a better future for all our people. It is a political project, not a military one.""
In 2008, McGuinness and Ian Paisley's successor Peter Robinson were nominated as first and deputy first minister.
Their relationship was less amicable than the one between McGuinness and Paisley, who died in September 2014.
The following year, Robinson and McGuinness became embroiled in controversy over the £1.2bn sale by Nama of its Northern Ireland property loans portfolio to US firm Cerberus.
In January 2016, Arlene Foster took over from Robinson as first minister of Northern Ireland.
In an interview a month later, Foster spoke of the difficulties she experienced with the deputy first minister, because of his graveside oration at the funeral of the man who, she believes, tried to kill her father.
Despite this - and the fact that the pair were on opposing sides of the subsequent Brexit vote, Mr McGuinness and Mrs Foster managed to forge a positive working relationship since they began sharing the OFMDFM portfolio.
In December, Mrs Foster insisted she had ""nothing to hide"" over the RHI scandal and refused to step down, but pressure mounted on Sinn Féin to act.
Last week, Martin McGuinness said that Mrs Foster should step aside as first minister to ""allow a time-framed, comprehensive, independent investigation"" into the RHI scheme. She refused.

31,"In just over two years Chen Guanming says he has travelled about 60,000km through 16 countries, overcoming floods, war zones, mountain passes and temperatures of -30C.
His aim, he said, was to ""spread the Olympic spirit"".
He says he left his home on 23 May 2010 and arrived in London on 9 July.
John Beeston, from Norwood Green, in west London, discovered him at the top of Lower Regent Street looking ""completely lost and downhearted"".
""At first I assumed it was a tourist rickshaw. Then I looked back and thought 'No, this is something different'.""
Mr Chen has pictures on his three-wheeled rickshaw of him posing in front of international landmarks and a banner saying he is on a journey of 140,000km (86,992 miles) - which includes China.
Mr Beeston, who runs an insurance brokers and travels to China on business, was able to chat to Mr Chen who is unable to speak English.
""I spoke with my limited Mandarin, asking if he was Chinese and he burst into life.""
He took him to Soho's Chinatown where Mr Chen told his story and has since been showered with admiration and offers of accommodation.
He has even been bought a Jamaican tracksuit top.
""They couldn't find a Chinese one,"" Mr Chen said.
His story sounds so fantastical that few would give it house room, but the 57-year-old from Jiangsu province in eastern China, has the passport, press cuttings and book full of messages from around the world, to testify to his feat.
""It's like telling people that a Martian has landed in the garden,"" said Mr Beeston.
""But, what he's done isn't dissimilar to what Marco Polo did and the Italians named an airport after him.""
In the first countries - Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam - he had to wring his clothes out seven or eight times a day because of the sweat. It was about 38C.
In Thailand, he was caught up in deadly floods.
On trying to leave South East Asia he was refused a visa in Burma.
Unperturbed, he backtracked and cycled to Tibet where he wended his way on his gearless bike up 7,000m high mountains.
Having crossed Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran he ended up in Turkey where it was -30C and he says he spent four days snowed in.
He says he supported himself couriering items along the way for people and through people's donations.
So was the journey worth it?
""London is especially beautiful,"" he says.
""People are very friendly. They always show warmth towards me.
""When I go back to China I want to tell them how civilised the English are.""
He wants to carry on spreading his message of peace and environmental protection, he says.
""I'm a big fan of Olympic Games,"" he says with typical understatement.
""I wanted to come here because I wanted the whole world to support the Olympics and be part of it.""
Ahead of the 2008 Olympic Games he led a personal crusade against littering, encouraging people to respect their environment.
To achieve this, he cycled to Beijing from his village, Erchen, in 2001 when China's bid was successful.
He says he went through 1,764 cities, covering more than 90,000km.
For three months he collected litter around Beijing and the Olympic Park.
He litter picked everything from cigarette butts to plastic bottles and was rewarded for his voluntary work by the authorities with a seat at the closing ceremony.
Now, he wants to be in the opening ceremony to round off his Olympic journey.
Asking Mr Chen if he thinks it will be ""difficult"" to take part in the ceremony on Friday seems crass given the scale of his achievement in coming this far.

32,"But the broad lines of the fight were drawn many months ago.
And the places where there were gaps in the campaigns were also obvious then: how much would Labour really cut in government to sort out the books? And how would the Conservatives really save £12bn from the welfare budget?
So far, there is no sign whatsoever that the two main parties will answer those significant questions in the next five weeks.
If you are a voter who has the audacity to want to know? Well, it seems that might just be tough luck.
It is not unusual in campaigns for political parties, particularly in opposition, to be well, slightly sketchy on detail.
People in my job spent much of the 2010 campaign asking the Conservatives what ""further and faster"" meant in terms of how they would get rid of the deficit.
They kept their answers firmly up their sleeve until after the campaign.
But with the election looming so very close, this silence doesn't help the stalemate.
Both sides are deeply, deeply reluctant to distract from their central message, and are playing to their base.
On Wednesday, the Conservatives released the names of 100 business people, many of whom have donated money to the party who, guess what, support their plans for the economy.
Labour are promising to legislate quickly to get rid of the worst kinds of zero-hours contracts where staff aren't guaranteed shifts and, by implication, wages.
The letter and the zero-hours announcement are important campaign moves.
But neither are surprising.
The caricature is big corporations versus the ordinary worker, or Goliath versus David, or the powerful and influential versus the hard-working less well off, with both parties as stuck in that narrative as the polling numbers are stuck in a numerical rut.
But despite the noise of the campaign so far, nothing much looks like moving votes.
Why? We are a long, long way from the era when politicians were fighting over the centre ground.
One senior Conservative told me, shaking their head: ""It is pathetic, everyone is playing to base, everyone has given up the centre.""
A key Labour figure put it a different way, describing the campaign as two ""parallel elections"".
However, that same source still believes they are playing to the centre ground. It is just that the centre ground, in their view, has moved.
But as strategists scratch their heads over the polls refusing to budge much beyond the margins of error, isn't it entirely possible that those two things are connected?
If the two main parties have more or less deserted the familiar centre, should we be surprised that it doesn't look like there will be any significant shifts of voters flocking to them?
One senior politician shrugged their shoulders disappointedly at what the main leaderships are offering right now:
""There is nothing inevitable about the idea of the end of big majorities, it's just that we are not offering voters very much that's worth going for.""
The risk perhaps is that both main parties could look like they are talking only to themselves and their existing supporters - in a campaign where they want to avoid answering hard questions, avoid saying anything unexpected, and avoid any surprises.
Add to this the determination of all of the parties not to publish their manifestos until well into April and this election might end up being characterised by a lack of ambition.
A lack of ambition in campaigns designed to make sure core voters turn up, rather than attracting the new in any significant numbers, and a lack of politicians' faith in their own ideas that makes them reluctant to share their full plans until late in the day, if at all.
Again and again, we hear voters around the country saying they want politicians to tell them what's what.
It is naïve to imagine that doesn't have risks of its own.
But as both of the main parties concentrate on gingerly carrying their core voters like a Ming vase to the finish line, their hands are too full to able to reach out to anyone else.
So what chance is there the two big parties will be able to break out of the stalemate?
Maybe only if they are willing to break this relative silence first.
PS: The delay in publishing manifestos is not just a point for the political nerds.
Manifesto commitments are not only important for the public to be able to scrutinise. They also give civil servants vital guidance on how parties wish to govern, and if a party does win power, the House of Lords is not able continually to block legislation from becoming law. if it has been part of a party's manifesto.","Ok, it is early days, very, very early days of the official election campaign.",32154966
33,"The tiles, made from glass, are intended to be a more attractive way to add solar panels to homes, compared with currently-used solar technology.
The launch took place in Universal Studios, Los Angeles, on what used to be the set for the television show Desperate Housewives.
It comes with Tesla due to take over struggling energy firm Solar City.
Some of the electric carmaker's investors have expressed concern over the takeover, suggesting it is a Tesla-funded bail-out of a company Mr Musk has a vested interest in as its biggest shareholder.
Solar City’s chief executive is Mr Musk’s cousin.
Bringing the solar tiles to the Desperate Housewives set was a way of displaying the idea’s key selling point: it looks far better than solar panelling. Mr Musk jokingly described it as a “sweet roof!”.
No price was given for the tiles, which come in a variety of colours and styles, though Mr Musk did say it would be cheaper than fitting a traditional roof and then adding solar on top.
Also part of the launch was Powerwall 2, Tesla’s home battery product. The primary function of the Powerwall is to store any surplus energy from the solar panels. It will cost $5,500 (£4,511), Mr Musk said.
Tesla posted a surprise profit in its last quarterly earnings - its first in three years.
The $2.6bn acquisition of Solar City seems set to see the company plunge back into the red, but Mr Musk insisted on Friday that the deal made sense as having separate companies would “slow things down”.

But now Ecotricity, one of the first green energy companies in the UK, said it is working on proposals to generate electricity through tidal energy.
In a letter sent to the UK government, it claimed Swansea could be the wrong place for such a project.
Ecotricity claims it can generate tidal energy at a lower price and financed over a shorter time than TLP.
The company's founder Dale Vince said the technology used to build the ""sea walls"" in Swansea was hundreds of years old and offered ""no technological advance"".
In the letter sent in January, he said: ""Our analysis suggests that Swansea Bay is simply the wrong sized project in the wrong place and it is these constraints that are at the root of its very high cost of energy.""
Ecotricity, based in Stroud in Gloucestershire, told BBC Wales it wrote to the UK government before it announced a review two weeks ago into the sector.
It believes tidal power can work at a lower price than the Â£168 per megawatt hour (MWh) across 35 years that is being discussed for Swansea Bay.
Founder Dale Vince said: ""We were concerned that the UK government was being pushed into paying too high a price for tidal energy through the Swansea Bay scheme.
""That would be bad for renewable energy generally because it would reinforce the myth that green energy is expensive, and bad for tidal power specifically because it may never get off the ground.""
Tidal Lagoon Power is now talking with the UK government about a lower price for their electricity generation over a longer, 90 year time frame, for Swansea.
But Ecotricity said it believes that price is too still too high.
The company will not say which sites it is looking at - including whether they would include Swansea - but acknowledges that the tidal range of the Severn Estuary is very attractive.
It will make a further announcement in the summer.
The review by the UK government - which is seeking ""clarity"" about the potential of tidal - is due to start in the spring and report in the autumn.
Ectotricity currently operates nearly 70 wind turbines, has 175,000 customers and powers the equivalent of more than 40,000 homes.
TLB - which last week said it welcomed the idea of competition - envisages Swansea as a first project to trial the technology with work starting next year.
Cardiff and Newport would be among future locations for larger lagoons which would be able to produce power even more cheaply.

''The Rugby World Cup was hugely disappointing for everyone associated with the England team and the subsequent review into the team's performance was always intended to be extremely comprehensive, which it has been,"" said Ritchie.
""Following the review, Stuart and I met, where we agreed that he should step down as head coach. This was subsequently ratified by the RFU board.""
He added: ""Despite the results during this World Cup he has much to be proud of, and has embedded a new group of players that will be representing England for a long time to come. Looking forward, we will leave no stone unturned to ensure England achieves sustained success in the future.""
Former England international Andy Goode: ""We were all excited pre-World Cup. But it was obviously a failure and, as he said, it was his responsibility. I am not surprised by the decision. It is probably the right one. There are some great coaches in the setup, who need to be looked at.""

Tim Bresnan (142 not out) and Ryan Sidebottom guided Yorkshire to the four batting bonus points required to ensure a Yorkshire win would secure the title, regardless of Somerset's result.
Middlesex closed on 81-2, 39 behind.
The home side had been reduced to 2-2, but first-innings centurion Nick Gubbins and Dawid Malan remained unbeaten through to the close.
Earlier, the hosts missed opportunities to take control of the match in the morning session as Yorkshire's Azeem Rafiq was dropped twice on his way to 65.
Bresnan reached his hundred off 222 balls but he started to run out of partners, and last man Sidebottom was required to help the visitors past the pivotal figure of 350.

A rain shower took the players off with Yorkshire 349-9, and spinner Ollie Rayner bowled a brilliant maiden over after the hour-long break before Sidebottom struck a boundary off Toby Roland-Jones.
The home side's response to Yorkshire's 390 began dreadfully as Sam Robson edged to Alex Lees off Sidebottom for a second duck in the match.

If travel is unavoidable, they should take precautions to avoid bites from mosquitoes that spread the disease.
Women planning to become pregnant should also be wary, says the National Travel Health Network and Centre.
Any pregnant woman who has recently travelled to a country where Zika is known to occur should tell their doctor or midwife.
The UK Foreign Office says people can search its website by country or territory to find out the latest situation.
The World Health Organization says the virus is likely to spread across nearly all of the Americas, apart from Canada and Chile.
Three Britons have already contracted the virus after travelling to South and Central America.
A spokeswoman from UK travel organisation Abta said women reconsidering their plans would be able to get a medical certificate from their family doctor in order to claim on insurance.
US experts at the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention say insect repellents containing active ingredients, such as DEET and picaridin, are safe for pregnant and breastfeeding women.
To lower the risk of infections spread by mosquitoes, pregnant women should use insect repellants, stay indoors during peak times of mosquito activity (usually dawn and dusk) and wear protective clothing (such as long-sleeve shirts, long pants, and socks).
Zika is transmitted by the Aedes mosquitoes. The infection often occurs without symptoms but can cause an illness similar to dengue.
Symptoms include:
Patients usually get better on their own, but the big concern is the damage the virus might do to an unborn child.

41,"Now Chris Buck, the director of Frozen and Tarzan, has got Disney fans talking by saying he thinks Anna and Elsa's parents were shipwrecked on an island, where they had a baby boy, Tarzan.
In an interview with MTV News, Buck said that although the movies are not officially linked, in his mind he sees Tarzan as being Anna and Elsa from Frozen's little brother!
The director also said: ""I say, whatever people want to believe, go for it. If you want to tie them all together, then do it!""
Here are a few of our favourite (unofficial) fan theories...
Continuing the family theme, Rapunzel and Eugene are very clearly seen arriving at Elsa's coronation in Frozen. Considering they don't live in Arendelle, as Tangled is set in Germany, some people think they must be on the VIP invite list. There are also a few family similarities - both Rapunzel and Elsa are blonde and both have powers that look pretty but are kind of weird. (Glowing magic hair? Snowmaker hands?)
If Elsa and Anna's parents' ship capsized, some think that could have been right around Atlantica, where Ariel lives. And their ship does look suspiciously like the one Ariel explored in The Little Mermaid...
Not only do they look alike and both love the colour yellow, but consider this: In a scene in Tarzan, Terk is drumming on a tea set. The pot looks suspiciously like Mrs. Potts from Beauty and the Beast (one of the teacups even appears to have a small chip). Some think that could mean that it was an heirloom passed down from great-great-great-grandma Belle.
This one is super complicated. It involves time travel and a whole bunch of magic, but basically, Boo learned how to travel through doors from Sully and Mike in Monsters, Inc. and some think when she grows up, she wants to find Sully again, so she time travels through doors to the time period of Brave. Why? Because she wants to understand the magical whisps, thinking they'll bring her back to Sully. While she's there, she takes up wood carving, which explains why she has a carving of Sully. It also explains why every time the door closes, the witch (AKA Boo) disappears.",Animation movie fans have many theories about how characters and plotlines from different films might just magically overlap.,33913322

It is hoped that stage one of the project to turn the site into a Â£10m heritage park will open in 2014.
Mr Hemingway said he was ""excited about bringing a new vibrant life to an iconic British seaside institution"".
""Having visited Margate over the past few months and seen the grassroots creative revolution that is taking place, we are thrilled, nay cock a hoop, at the potential of the place and can't wait to get stuck in,"" he said.

43,"State Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem has said more than one judge should have a chance to review the law.
The law bans abortions after a foetal heartbeat is detected, as early as six weeks into pregnancy.
In April, District Judge Daniel Hovland found the law ""invalid and unconstitutional"".
""The United States Supreme Court has spoken and has unequivocally said no state may deprive a woman of the choice to terminate her pregnancy at a point prior to viability,"" Judge Hovland wrote in his ruling.
The US Supreme Court ruled in the landmark Roe v Wade decision of 1973 that abortion must be legal until a foetus is viable, typically 22-24 weeks.
""The legislature passed the law in hopes that a higher court would revisit the issue,"" Mr Stenehjem said in a statement to the Associated Press news agency.
""It seems prudent that an appellate court should have an opportunity to consider the issue rather than have one judge overturn the judgment of the legislative assembly.""
The case will now be heard by the US 8th Circuit Court of Appeals.
North Dakota's anti-abortion law was one of four such bills Republican Governor Jack Dalrymple signed into law in 2013.
The state's sole abortion clinic and the Center for Reproductive Rights sued to overturn the law and a US district judge ruled in April.

44,"It hopes to prevent ""unconscious bias"" and tap a more diverse ""talent pool"".
For next year's recruitment round for 1,500 graduates and school leavers, an algorithm will consider ""contextual"" information alongside academic results.
It will take into account disadvantages such as attending an under-performing school or coming from a deprived area.
As an example, Deloitte says an applicant getting three B grades at A-level could be seen as ""exceptional"" if the average for their school was three D grades.
There will be a ""university-blind"" approach to selection, so that the name of the university attended will not be known.
The aim is to find students with ""potential"" and to prevent the recruitment process producing an intake from a narrow range of universities and social backgrounds.
""Improving social mobility is one of the UK's biggest challenges,"" said David Sproul, senior partner and chief executive of Deloitte UK.
But Mr Sproul said there was also a ""business imperative"", as firms needed ""to hire people who think and innovate differently, come from a variety of backgrounds and bring a range of perspectives"".
The move by Deloitte is the latest in a wave of changes by graduate recruiters wanting to look beyond academic results.
Ernst and Young has scrapped a requirement for school leavers to have the equivalent of three B grades at A-level or graduates to have an upper second class degree.
The accountancy firm will remove all academic and education details from its application process.

47,"It blames a ""failure of leadership"" at Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust.
It says the deaths of mental health and learning-disability patients were not properly examined.
Southern Health said it ""fully accepted"" the quality of processes for investigating and reporting a death needed to be better, but had improved.
The trust is one of the country's largest mental health trusts, covering Hampshire, Dorset, Wiltshire, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire and providing services to about 45,000 people.
The investigation, commissioned by NHS England and carried out by Mazars, a large audit firm, looked at all deaths at the trust between April 2011 and March 2015.
During that period, it found 10,306 people had died.
Most were expected. However, 1,454 were not.
Of those, 272 were treated as critical incidents, of which just 195 - 13% - were treated by the trust as a serious incident requiring investigation (SIRI).
The likelihood of an unexpected death being investigated depended hugely on the type of patient.
The most likely group to see an investigation was adults with mental health problems, where 30% were investigated.
For those with learning disability the figure was 1%, and among over-65s with mental health problems it was just 0.3%.
The average age at death of those with a learning disability was 56 - over seven years younger than the national average.
Even when investigations were carried out, they were of a poor quality and often extremely late, the NHS England report says.
Repeated criticisms from coroners about the timeliness and usefulness of reports provided for inquests by Southern Health failed to improve performance, while there was often little effort to engage with the families of the deceased.
The reasons for the failures, says the report, lie squarely with senior executives and the trust board.
There was no ""effective"" management of deaths or investigations or ""effective focus or leadership from the board"", it says.
Even when the board did ask relevant questions, the report says, they were constantly reassured by executives that processes were robust and investigations thorough.
But the Mazars investigators said: ""This is contrary to our findings.""
The culture of Southern Health, which has been led by Katrina Percy since it was created in 2011, ""results in lost learning, a lack of transparency when care problems occur, as well as lack of assurance to families that a death was not avoidable and has been properly investigated,"" the report says.
The report was ordered in 2013, after Connor Sparrowhawk, 18, drowned in a bath following an epileptic seizure while a patient in a Southern Health hospital in Oxford.
An independent investigation said his death had been preventable, and an inquest jury found neglect by the trust had contributed to his death.
Responding to the report's findings, Connor's mother, Sara Ryan, said the entire leadership of Southern Health had to go.
She said: ""There is no reason why in 2015 a report like this should come out. It's a total scandal. It just sickens me.""
The report's authors, who spent months looking into how Southern Health failed to investigate so many deaths, seem to concur.
They say: ""We have little confidence that the trust has fully recognised the need for it to improve its reporting and investigation of deaths.""
In response, Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust said it accepted its processes ""had not always been up to the high standards our patients, their families and carers deserve.
""However, we have already made substantial improvements in this area over a sustained period of time.""
It added: ""These issues are not unique to the trust and we welcome the opportunity to shine a spotlight on this important area.
""Though the trust continues to challenge the draft report's interpretation of the evidence, our focus and priority is on continuing to improve the services we provide for our patients.""
It said that when the final report was published by NHS England, it would review the recommendations and make any further changes necessary.
An NHS England spokesman said: ""We commissioned an independent report because it was clear that there are significant concerns.
""We are determined that, for the sake of past, present and future patients and their families, all the issues should be forensically examined and any lessons clearly identified and acted upon.""
It added: ""The final full independent report will be published as soon as possible, and all the agencies involved stand ready to take appropriate action.""
Norman Lamb, who was the care minister in the coalition government, said the findings were shocking: ""You end up with a sense that these lives are regarded somehow as slightly less important than others and there can be no second class citizens in our NHS.
""The thought is just horrifying and there have to be some answers from the trust.""","The NHS has failed to investigate the unexpected deaths of more than 1,000 people since 2011, according to a report obtained by BBC News.",35051845
48,"MakerBot Industries, best known for its small 3D printers, has opened a shop in Manhattan through which it will aim to sell the joys of home fabrication to the general public.
The store opening comes as MakerBot releases the second incarnation of its Replicator 3D printer.
The Replicator 2.0 works to much finer resolutions than earlier versions and can fabricate much bigger objects.
MakerBot said the store, the first of its kind, would act as a showcase for 3D printing and stage demonstrations and workshops for those who were curious about the technology.
3D printing involves building up objects layer by layer out of plastic that is melted and fed via a carefully controlled nozzle to form a shape. The printers were initially used in engineering and design firms to produce and refine prototypes.
Now many home hackers, makers and artists use 3D printers to turn out their own customised creations. Examples include model soldiers, cases for home electronic projects, and furniture for dolls' houses.
Bre Pettis said the Replicator 2.0 was aimed at the ""prosumer"" - either a design professional or a hardcore hobbyist. The device costs $2,199 (Â£1,360) and builds objects up in layers only 100 microns thick. In previous versions, each layer was about 270 microns thick.
Mat Fordy, founder and boss of coolcomponents.co.uk that sells 3D printers and other home hacking gear, said the technology was proving popular.
""We've really seen the affordable 3D printer market in the UK explode over the last couple of years,"" he told the BBC. ""Many types of people use them, not just professionals, but people who have an idea that they need to touch and hold.""
He said the new MakerBot was a great looking piece of kit but supply problems had made it hard to get hold of.
""They never seem to have enough to go around, and that puts a lot of people off,"" he said. ""Other excellent printers are in ready supply, and many people just give up waiting and get one of those instead.""",The gospel about 3D printing is being taken to the streets of New York.,19665625

Lawyer Gary Withey also faces charges along with David Whitehouse, Paul Clark and David Grier, who all worked for administrators Duff and Phelps.
The remaining nine charges are being heard at a preliminary hearing at the High Court in Edinburgh.
Among the allegations dropped by the Crown was a charge that the joint administrators, David Whitehouse and Paul Clark, attempted to pervert the course of justice.
Prosecutors also withdrew a charge that the pair, along with Mr Whyte, Mr Withey and Mr Grier, agreed to do something that they knew or suspected or ought reasonably to have known or suspected would enable or further the commission of serious organised crime.

Verstappen, who turns 17 next month, currently races in Formula Three.
""I'm a relaxed guy. I will handle it,"" Verstappen, who will replace Jean-Eric Vergne at Toro Rosso, told the BBC.
Verstappen is the son of former Formula 1 driver Jos, 42, who contested 106 grands prix for teams such as Benetton and Tyrrell between 1994 and 2003.
Max Verstappen will break the record for F1's youngest ever driver by almost two years when he lines up for his debut next year.
Spain's Jaime Alguersuari - who was 19 years and 125 days when he raced in Hungary, also for Toro Rosso, in 2009 - is the current record holder. Alguersuari left Torro Rosso and F1 at the end of the 2011 season.
The youngest driver to earn a Championship point is Toro Rosso's Daniil Kvyat, who was 19 when he finished ninth in this season's opening race in Australia. The Russian will be Verstappen's team-mate in 2015.
Verstappen was a successful kart racer before driving for Van Amersfoort Racing in this year's Formula Three Championship.
He made an impressive transition to F3, winning six consecutive races at one stage, and has eight victories in 27 races so far this season, leaving him second to Frenchman Esteban Ocon in the overall standings.
Although he will graduate to F1 with fewer than 40 single-seater races under his belt, it is not unheard of for drivers to make the step up to the top level of the sport with such low levels of experience.
Finland's Kimi Raikkonen had only contested 23 single-seater races when he graduated to F1 in 2001. He went on to become world champion in 2007 and is a 20-time grand prix winner.
Verstappen is not fazed by his fast-track progress and believes the hardest transition has already been made.
""I think the biggest step I had was karting to F3. I think F3 to F1 will be a smaller step,"" he told BBC Radio 5 live.
""I'm not that worried about it. The cars are a really safe. I think it's more dangerous to bike through a big city than race in an F1 car.""
Verstappen's F3 team boss also believes he can succeed.
""It is a huge step but I think if anyone can do it, it's Max,"" Frits van Amersfoort told the BBC. ""I've never seen a kid that age who is so calm and so relaxed. He has incredible feeling with the car.
""Time will tell and it's a huge step, but I think Max is capable of doing it. He will need some guidance and Toro Rosso will give him that for sure.""
By joining Red Bull's junior team, Verstappen is following the same career path as four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel and his Red Bull team-mate, Australian Daniel Ricciardo.
BBC 5 live correspondent James Allen said Verstappen might have the necessary requirements to race in F1 but that some drivers would be concerned at sharing the grid with a 17-year-old.
""The governing body, the FIA, has to award a super licence and you can't race a Formula 1 car until you've got a super licence,"" Allen explained.
""The minimum requirement for that is some victories in certain important feeder categories.
""Verstappen ticks the boxes, so he is eligible for a super licence, but I think there will be quite a debate this weekend at the Belgian GP.""

The court heard how in July last year, Choudhury took part in a demonstration in Cardiff protesting about the conflict in Gaza.
He carried a banner proclaiming his support for Islamic State which brought him to the attention of anti-terrorism officers.
Prosecutor Sarah Whitehouse QC said in the weeks following the demonstration, Choudhury accessed websites about travelling to Syria and another one that was entitled ""10 reasons to join ISIS"".
Ms Whitehouse said he also downloaded images that showed his active interest in extremism and had conversations on social media about travelling to Turkey and Syria to fight.
Choudhury was arrested last December and during interview he repeatedly said he supported IS and that he would be happy to kill non-believers under Islamic State rule.
He was due to go on trial on Wednesday at the Old Bailey, but changed his plea after the jury had been sworn in.
In mitigation, defence barrister Abdul Iqbal said Choudhury did not appreciate the complexities of Middle East politics and he had been deeply influenced by older men in the Cardiff area who he considered to be more learned than him.

He said: ""It is unbelievable that after all these years of waiting, of stalling and uncertainty, we now find out that the families will have to pay for a copy of the report.

56,"The German car maker also said it would plead guilty to breaking certain US laws.
VW said it was in advanced discussions with the Department of Justice and US Customs about the deal.
The final agreement has yet to be approved by VW's management and supervisory board, which could happen later on Tuesday or Wednesday.
VW said it had negotiated a ""concrete draft"" of a settlement with US authorities that included criminal and civil fines totalling $4.3bn, as well as appointing an independent monitor for the next three years.
The $4.3bn fine means that the total costs associated with the emissions cheating scandal are set to exceed the $19.2bn the company has set aside to deal with the issue.
VW has already agreed to a $15bn civil settlement with environmental authorities and car owners in the US.
The scandal erupted in September 2015 when the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) found that many VW cars sold in America had a ""defeat device"" - or software - in diesel engines that could detect when they were being tested and adjust the performance accordingly to improve results.
The German car giant subsequently admitted cheating emissions tests in the US and many countries throughout the world, including the UK.
Arndt Ellinghorst, head of global automotive research at Evercore ISI, said the draft settlement was good news for VW and would ""draw a line under all remaining US-related legal risk"".
It was important that VW had ""managed to come to an agreement that allows the company to move on"", he said, adding: ""It's a major relief that this doesn't get dragged into the new US administration.""
Mr Ellinghorst expected the company to increase its provisions for diesel-related costs by up to €3bn to as much as €21bn.
On Monday it emerged that VW executives knew about emissions cheating two months before the scandal broke, but chose not to tell US regulators, according to court papers.
The bosses involved include Oliver Schmidt, who was in charge of VW's US environmental regulatory compliance office from 2012 until March 2015.
On Monday he was charged with conspiracy to defraud and has been remanded ahead of a court appearance on Thursday.",Volkswagen has agreed a draft $4.3bn (£3.5bn) settlement with US authorities over the emissions-rigging scandal.,38578004

58,"Printed in 1611 and known as the ""Great She Bible"", it is one of the earliest known copies of the King James Version (KJV) of the Christian holy book.
It will be displayed at St Mary's Parish Church in Gisburn on Saturday.
The Reverend Anderson Jeremiah and the Reverend Alexander Baker found the old book following their appointment at the church last August.
It is called a ""She Bible"" because Chapter 3, Verse 15 of the Book of Ruth mistakenly reads: ""She went into the city"".
Thought to be typographical mistake, this verse was changed from another KJV edition which said ""He"".
The Bible has been assessed and authenticated by the Antiquarian Booksellers' Association.
Only a handful of the ""She Bibles"" still exist. Oxford and Cambridge Universities have one, as do Salisbury, Exeter and Durham cathedrals.
The historical significance of the Bible was not highlighted in the parish records so it was stored in a cupboard at the back of the church.
Mr Baker said: ""It was a really exciting thing to discover - it looks just like something out of Harry Potter.
""One of the wonderful things about worshipping in a church as old as ours is the sense of history that oozes from its walls and discovering the treasures it has to offer.
""But we were stunned to discover a treasure as rare as this. We knew as soon as we saw the date of the New Testament it was a significant find.""
Dr Jeremiah added: ""It's amazing to think we are able to hold a book printed as the direct result of the command of King James 400 years ago.""
""This English language version of the Bible was created to encourage ordinary people to discover the Good News of Jesus Christ for themselves and it is likely that it was the book that first took God's word into many people's homes in this part of Lancashire.

59,"Pre-tax profit at the clothing and homeware retailer dropped 5.5% from £836.1m to £790.2m last year.
The firm, which had already warned profits would fall, said it remained ""extremely cautious"" about trading.
It said shoppers were shifting their spending away from clothing, at the same time as inflation was rising and incomes were being squeezed.
The profit drop in 2016 was the first for the retailer since the financial crisis of 2008.
Despite the fall, investors sent Next shares 8% higher in early trading in London.
Richard Hunter, head of research at Wilson King Investment Management, said investors were pleased with growth in the directory business and further details on a special dividend.
Sales at Next's online and catalogue business rose 4% to £1.7bn. But the retailer said shoppers continued to shift away from the High Street, as sales at its bricks-and-mortar business fell 3% to £2.3bn.
Next chairman John Barton said: ""Trading conditions in the year ahead will continue to be tough, however I believe that by focusing on our core strengths, as we did during 2008, we will see Next emerge from this period stronger than before.""
Next has ""had a remarkable record of out-performing its main competitors"", especially M&S, in the past eight years, said Bryan Roberts of retail consultancy TCC Global.
But the ""general malaise"" for retailers is now catching up with them, Mr Roberts told the BBC.
""We're spending less money on things and more on experiences or leisure,"" he said, adding that rising inflation and slowing growth in wages was also putting retailers under pressure.
There was also a ""bit of an admission of guilt from Next"" that they were ""chasing the more fashionable end of the market and neglecting some of their core, mainstream ranges"", he said.
Next said that by focusing energy on ""adopting exciting new trends"" it had omitted some of its ""best-selling, heartland product from our ranges"".
It said this would improve in the summer ranges, but added ""we will not have our ranges where we want them until the autumn season"".
Among the other challenges it was facing, Next warned that price inflation, which it attributed to the fall in sterling, might not ease until the second half of 2018.
It also said that with more and more shoppers going online, it was ""legitimate to question the long term viability of retail stores"".
Chief executive Lord Wolfson said: ""The year ahead looks set to be another tough year for Next.

Fire investigators have confirmed it started through an electrical circuit or item.
Phil Thompson, who has run the market for four years, said it was a ""relief"" to know it was not started on purpose.
He said: ""You're thinking the worst of everything, someone getting in and doing something but obviously that's not the case which is lovely, absolutely brilliant.
""But for a freezer to cause this devastation is absolutely terrible.""
Mr Thompson said the ice cream freezer was on the first floor of the bowling alley.
He said CCTV footage shows the appliance going up in flames - but a spokesman for Norfolk Fire and Rescue service said the findings of the investigation were yet to be confirmed.

61,"Not satisfied with the inevitable psychological blow to title rival Nico Rosberg that must have come with the knowledge that Hamilton had gained 49 points on him in just six races, the world champion openly undermined his Mercedes team-mate in the post-race news conference. While sitting right next to him.
And after sitting listening to it, Rosberg waded right in there himself.
The argument was about the events of qualifying, when Hamilton had lost out on pole to Rosberg on Saturday in controversial circumstances.
Hamilton was far from the only driver who felt stewards had been wrong in allowing Rosberg to keep the lap time that was set while double-waved yellow flags - the highest caution warning before a safety car - were being displayed.
Despite that, he said at the time he was ""not too disappointed"", while adding that he felt the situation needed clarifying.
But the incident clearly still rankled after the race.
""The stewards need to come up with some kind of solution because the whole 23 years of my racing, it has been 'if it's yellow flag, you slow down' and if it's double yellow flag, you be prepared to stop and Nico was doing the same speed at the apex as I was doing on the previous timed lap,"" Hamilton said, as Rosberg sat, face like thunder, alongside him.
""If there happened to be a car that was spun or a marshal on the track, it would have been pretty hard for him to have slowed down in that case.
""And the fact that he didn't get penalised for it means that we need to be careful because the message we're sending not only to the drivers here but also to the drivers in the lower categories is that it's now possible for you to lose only one 10th of a second in a double-waved yellow flag section, which is one of the most dangerous scenarios.
""They need to clear that up because before it was two-tenths that you were meant to lose with one yellow flag and half a second with two yellow flags. It wasn't the case yesterday and there was no penalty.
""So going into the next race, we could be battling for pole position and we see double yellow flags and we know we only have to do a small lift and lose one-tenth of a second and we'll be fine and go purple in the sector.""
Before the compere had a chance to move things on to the next subject, Rosberg jumped in and asked for right of reply.
""Thank you for making that statement,"" he said to Hamilton, slapping him on the shoulder, voice dripping with sarcasm, before going on to say that he had lifted off the throttle 30 metres earlier than normal for the corner and entered it ""20km/h slower"".
""That's a completely different world in an F1 car,"" Rosberg said. ""Everything is safe. So definitely I significantly reduced my speed and that's what it says you need to do and that's why for the stewards that was completely acceptable.""
As for the increased speed at the apex of the corner, Rosberg said that was to be expected ""on a drying track"".
Hamilton was not finished, though. A couple of hours later, he raised it again in another news conference, this time in the Mercedes motorhome.
He initially said he ""didn't want to get into that again - I don't want to get into a war. It wasn't accurate what Nico actually said but it doesn't really matter"".
But a few questions later, he could not help himself, saying ""lifting and coasting into a corner is fuel saving, and braking at the same place and getting on the power five metres earlier and being the same speed at the apex and much quicker at the exit is not preparing [to stop, as demanded by the rules]"".
Technically, both men had a point. Rosberg was allowed to keep the time because stewards adjudged him to have slowed down sufficiently.
The drivers work to guidelines that sufficient slowing of pace for a double-waved yellow flag is to lose 0.5 seconds in a section of track defined by timing loops.
These are normally eight seconds long. But in this case, the timing section was only three seconds long. Rosberg slowed by a little under 0.2secs; so, technically, pro rata, that was enough.
The issue for the other drivers was whether this interpretation was the appropriate one in the circumstances. Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel and Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo were among the leading drivers who felt it was not.
This will run and run - Hamilton has said he has already raised it with FIA F1 director Charlie Whiting. ""He is going to think about it because that's not the way it should be,"" Hamilton said, adding that he would definitely raise it as a discussion topic in Friday's drivers' briefing at next weekend's German Grand Prix.
Of course, a tasty public row between team-mates and title rivals is good box office. But what is more interesting is what this says about the relationship between the two men.
Three races ago, before the European Grand Prix, Hamilton was saying how the things between himself and Rosberg were as good as they had been for years.
Rosberg put the lie to that in an interview before this weekend's race in Hungary. And now Hamilton has effectively undermined his own argument.
He could have kept this behind closed doors, dealt with it privately with Whiting. He could have mentioned it once and left it. But to bring it up three times in separate situations seemed to many like an attempt to unsettle Rosberg, perhaps even rub in the dispiriting turnaround in the championship.
Hamilton feels a sense of superiority over Rosberg; that has been clear for a long time. And it's not hard to see why.
Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff said after the race that it will always be close between Hamilton and Rosberg and that he expects the championship to go to the wire this season.
He may well be right, on one level. But the statistics of their time as team-mates tell their own story.
In two and a half seasons, Hamilton has won 26 races and Rosberg 16.
Three times in 2014, Hamilton's first world title for Mercedes, he made up gaps of 25 points - a clear win - or more and still won the championship by a significant margin after a difficult start to the season.
Last year, he walked it, hardly letting Rosberg get a look-in until the title was was good as sewn up.
And this year has strong echoes of 2014 again. Another difficult start - the worst part of it consecutive engine failures in qualifying in China and Russia - left Hamilton 43 points behind after four races.
In the next race, the two men crashed together on the first lap and had the riot act read to them by Wolff.
This, Hamilton said on Sunday, had felt like ""rock bottom"" but ""ended up being a turning point"".
""Where do we go from here?"" he said of his thoughts at the time. ""The only way was up. I managed to get my head together and get on with it.""
Since then, he has hardly looked back. But for a bizarrely error-strewn qualifying session in Baku, he may well have won all six races.
If Hamilton's remarks were an attempt to score a psychological point, it was probably unnecessary. Hamilton utterly dominated in Hungary, even if he had an up-and-down weekend.
Blisteringly fast in first practice, he crashed at the start of the second. Struggling as a result in final practice, he was nevertheless on course for a pole with a lap that would probably have been half a second up on Rosberg's only to come across Fernando Alonso's spun McLaren broadside across the track.
In the end, the row over the yellow flags that incident produced was irrelevant. Hamilton made a slightly better start than Rosberg, and in a five-car concertina at the first corner involving both Mercedes, both Red Bulls and Vettel, the world champion emerged in the lead.
From there, he controlled the race at will, going only as fast as he needed to, upping the pace when asked. He kept Rosberg at arm's length as he protected the delicate Pirelli tyres - ""like having £100 to spend and having to be careful how you spend it,"" Hamilton said afterwards.
He was ""proud"" he said, of how he had closed what he had thought back in Spain might be an insurmountable gap.
It will take more than this to break Rosberg, but his mantra that ""it is only small differences that decide it; I just have to turn them around in my favour"" is starting to wear thin.
More often than not, those differences are in Hamilton's favour.
His engine problems early in the season mean Hamilton will take a major grid penalty at one of the remaining nine races, which will almost certainly hand Rosberg an easy win such is Mercedes' superiority.
But if the battle between them continues in its usual manner, Hamilton is surely on his way to his fourth title and public point-scoring won't be necessary.","Lewis Hamilton leads the World Championship for the first time this season after his dominant victory in the Hungarian Grand Prix, but in some ways events after the race were just as important as what happened on track.",36879742

63,"The sport's governing body, wants to ""bridge the gap"" between the amateur and professional ranks, whilst maintaining its Olympic status.
We have 10 categories for men, so why only three for women?
International Boxing Association (AIBA) president Dr Ching-Kuo ""CK"" Wu said of the women's weight divisions: ""Three is certainly not enough.
""We have 10 categories [for men], so why only three for women?""
And he added: ""It is because of [the International Olympic Committee's] quota. They have a limit of 10,600 athletes in total, and just 286 boxers.
""So we reduced the men's categories by one to make room for 36 women. It is a step in the right direction.
""AIBA is trying its best. Talk to the IOC!""
Women's boxing is not the only innovation AIBA has brought in for London - there is also a new scoring system.
Five judges score each round independently, and then a computer selects the three ""similar scores"" on the cards. Each boxer is given the average of his or her similar scores.
If there are no scores clustered together, the computer drops the highest and lowest, and records the average of the three remaining scores.
The other major change is that these scores are only updated at the end of each round.
""It's very simple and absolutely impossible to manipulate,"" said Wu, while admitting the changes could have been communicated better.
But this could be a brief chapter in Olympic history, as Wu wants to introduce the 10-point scoring used in professional boxing and AIBA's hybrid competition, the World Series of Boxing (WSB).
""You are not only scoring punches, you are assessing the shape of the fight, the style. The judges have more to consider,"" he said.
""But we will wait until all our judges reach that standard.""
And with AIBA-sanctioned boxers already competing without head guards and vests, there is also no secret about Wu's desire to do away with these historic elements of the amateur game.

64,"They're laden with Christmas bags, overflowing with toys.
Beatrice has just celebrated a very special birthday. And rather than gifts, she asked her friends and family to donate to the toy bank instead.
""Aren't I lucky? 80! I don't want to say it, but 80 years of age,"" smiled Beatrice.
""I don't need anything. I've got a good home, good husband, good family, and we're well looked after. So what was the point in them buying me stuff? I mean, there's stuff in that wardrobe I think I've had since I was about 15. But somebody else can benefit from it.""
The toy bank, based at 905 Govan Road, has been set up by volunteers, and will work with local community groups and food banks to find parents who need help.
Organiser John Beattie says locals are concerned about the growing number of people who are using food banks.
""People are really struggling this Christmas financially,"" he said.
""We have seen explosions in the numbers of people using food banks, and if people are struggling to feed themselves and their children, then they're going to have quite a poor Christmas, so we're really here to support those people.
From baby dolls to dinosaurs, Tonka trucks to teddy bears; the toys are starting to pile up. And as long as they are in good condition, they don't have to be brand new.
""This is the problem we have in our house,"" says John. ""I've got an eight-year-old, and every year we have a clear-out before Christmas, and some of the toys are in perfectly good working condition.
""So that's the idea, that's why we set up a wee bit earlier - to catch people who will be having clear-outs of their kids previous toys.""
The toy bank operates in Govan, but aims to help parents across the south of Glasgow - hence the name Community and Beyond.
Parents who are worried about the extra cost of Christmas can contact them directly, or through the local food banks.
They will be asked what age and sex their children are, and what sort of toys they would like to wake up to on Christmas morning.
Claire McCunnie is a development worker at the Glasgow South West food bank, and says she knows many mothers who could use some help.
""Once they pay their bills they just don't have enough to stretch, and obviously with Christmas coming up, that just makes life worse,"" she said.
""It just means they know their kid will get something, and that's all mothers want. They just want to give their children as much as they can. They want to feed their kids, and they want to make sure their kids have something on Christmas Day. And that's why this is fantastic.""
And with her 80 years of experience, Beatrice Caddell agrees. ""As you grow older, and you think about the past, about what you've done for them, how you've brought them up. As long as they're OK, we're OK. It's as simple as that. You never stop being a mum and dad.""
As they sort through the donations, the volunteers put them into piles according to age and type. They will be cleaned, wrapped up, and delivered from mid-December.
It's hoped all these toys can be found a good home for Christmas.","As they struggle out of the cold and into the new Community and Beyond Toy Bank in Govan, there's a warm welcome for Beatrice Caddell and her daughter Lynn.",34943156
65,"It says it has reached agreement with Austria on five crossing points on their border.
Authorities in Bavaria have complained a lack of co-ordination with Austria is hampering efforts to aid new arrivals.
Many others continue to make their way via Greece, in freezing temperatures, hoping to get asylum in Germany.
Meanwhile, more than 20 migrants - many of them children - have drowned in more boat sinkings in Greek waters while they were trying to reach European Union countries via Turkey.
Greek officials said 19 people had died and 138 were rescued near the island of Kalymnos.
Three others died off Rhodes and three were missing. Six were rescued there.
And the Spanish coastguard called off the search for 35 migrants missing at sea the day after their boat was shipwrecked en route from Morocco.
Fifteen migrants were rescued alive from the vessel and the bodies of four others were found.
A spokeswoman for Germany's interior ministry told AFP news agency that the new rules on entry points would go into effect immediately.
""We would like to have a more orderly procedure,"" she said.
A senior Bavarian politician said that under the agreement, 50 migrants an hour could cross into the state at the five agreed points.
Earlier this week, German Interior Minister Thomas de Maziere accused Austria of transporting refugees to the German frontier at night, leaving them there unannounced.
Federal police spokesman Heinrich Onstein has said everything was being done to prevent the migrants from having to sleep outdoors.
He said the problem had been that  ""we do not know how many people will arrive, and at which border post"".
However an Austrian police spokesman dismissed such accusations as a ""joke"", given that Austria was receiving 11,000 people a day just at the Spielfeld crossing from Slovenia.
Germany expects at least 800,000 asylum seekers this year - some estimates put it as high as 1.5 million. That is at least four times the number who arrived last year.
Last Wednesday, more than 8,000 migrants arrived in Bavaria, German police said.
And last weekend authorities in Passau - a major transit hub for asylum seekers - said they had been overwhelmed by a new influx of some 15,000 people who arrived from Austria.
Several hundred spent a night out in the cold on the Austrian side of the border before reaching Germany, as the Austrian authorities said they had run out of beds for them.
The UN estimates that more than 700,000 migrants have crossed to Europe by boat so far this year - many of them refugees from war-torn Syria. The approach of winter has so far done little to slow the flow.

66,"Mr McAfee made the offer to the FBI in an article published by Business Insider.
Apple has refused to comply with a court order asking it to unlock the device, dividing opinion over whether the firm should be compelled to do so.
Mr McAfee said he and his team would take on the task ""free of charge"".
The offer came as Mr McAfee continues his campaign as a US presidential candidate for the Libertarian Party.
""It will take us three weeks,"" he claimed in his article.
Security expert Graham Cluley told the BBC he was sceptical of Mr McAfee's claims.
""The iPhone is notoriously difficult to hack compared to other devices,"" he said.
For instance, Mr Cluley cast doubts on Mr McAfee's idea that he could use ""social engineering"" to work out the pass-code of Farook's locked iPhone.
This is a process by which hackers try to find out login credentials by tricking people into giving them away.
""In a nutshell, dead men tell no tales,"" said Mr Cluley. ""Good luck to Mr McAfee trying to socially engineer a corpse into revealing its pass-code.""
""The FBI isn't interested anyway, they want to set a precedent that there shouldn't be locks they can't break,"" he added.
In his article, Mr McAfee stated that he was keen to unlock the device because he didn't want Apple to be forced to implement a ""back door"" - a method by which security services could access data on encrypted devices.
Chief executive of Apple Tim Cook had previously said in a statement that the firm did not want to co-operate.
He argued that introducing a back door would make all iPhones vulnerable to hacking by criminals.
Mr McAfee believes that it would be possible to retrieve data from the phone by other means - though he did not give many details of how it would be done.

67,"Airbnb confirmed it was quietly cancelling accounts of those travelling to Charlottesville to attend the ""Unite the Right"" rally on Saturday.
The company cited its discrimination policy, but users decried the move as a violation of free speech.
The row marks the latest flashpoint in a debate over rights to free speech.
Members of the so-called alt-right movement, which includes groups accused of racism and anti-Semitism, are expected to descend on Charlottesville on Saturday for the ""Unite the Right"" rally, to protest against the city's removal of a Confederate General Robert E Lee statue.
The event was scheduled to take place at a park that was also the locale of a raucous Ku Klux Klan rally in May. The park, formerly Lee Park, was renamed as Emancipation Park in June.
Speakers at the event include Richard Spencer, a leader of the alt-right movement, while members of the National Socialist Movement, the Traditionalist Workers Party and the neo-Nazi Daily Stormer website have said they will attend.
The Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors hate groups, said the event could be ""the largest hate-gathering of its kind in decades in the United States"".
However, it is unclear how many people the event is expected to attract. NBC29 reported that the event permit to host the event was for 400 people, but the Washington Post reports police are preparing for as many as 4,000 attendees.
Airbnb said it began removing accounts affiliated with the event after a user reported a thread of comments suggesting company properties would be used for after-parties for the neo-Nazi website, Daily Stormer.
The company issued a statement noting that it had established an Airbnb ""Community Commitment"" policy in 2016, which asked members to sign a pledge to ""accept people regardless of their race, religion, national origin, ethnicity, disability, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation or age"".
The policy was created after the online accommodation site faced criticism over anecdotal evidence that black users routinely found it more difficult to book a room than white individuals.
The anti-discrimination agreement was directed at Airbnb hosts, but the latest move appeared to be the first time the company targeted guests.
The move caused a social media uproar, in which Twitter and 4chan users began posting Airbnb messages to banned users, noting the decision was ""irreversible and will affect any duplicated or future accounts"".
""People shouldn't just #boycottairbnb they should sue @airbnb"", one user wrote.
In a statement to the BBC, rally organiser Jason Kessler called the move ""outrageous"" and said it ""should be grounds for a lawsuit"".
""It is the racial targeting of white people for their ethnic advocacy. The Unite the Right rally is opposed to the historical and demographic displacement of white people. Would Airbnb cancel the service of black nationalists or Black Lives Matter activists for their social media activity? Of course not!""
Airbnb argues that while it respects the right to freedom of expression, people have a moral responsibility to take action when facing extreme hatred.
The company cites its ""Community Commitment"", or pledge to treat all people equally, in terminating accounts ahead of Saturday's march.
Mr Kessler argues the company's anti-discrimination policy was intended to keep renters from ""denying service to individuals based on race, religion or other identity characteristics"".
""They have now unjustly expanded that policy to imply that they will search through your social media accounts looking for controversial opinions and deny service based on that,"" he said.
The debate recalls a case appearing before the US Supreme Court in October, in which a Colorado baker with religious objection to same-sex marriage lost a discrimination lawsuit for refusing to create a cake for a gay couple.
The case is a touchstone for longstanding culture wars over same-sex marriage, religious freedom and the First Amendment right to free speech.
Though anti-discrimination laws offer protections to the LGBTQ community in 21 states and the District of Columbia, no federal law requires bars private businesses from refusing to serve customers based on sexual orientation.
As a private business, Airbnb may be entitled to those same freedoms.
In an interview with the BBC last year, Airbnb co-founder Brian Chesky said: ""We made a decision that this is not a service for everybody. We said 'take it somewhere else. Not Airbnb.
""We started this company with the belief people are fundamentally good. Mostly everyone is really good, but when you have 100 million people, there are some who don't believe in what you believe in.""
While it is unclear how AirBnB screens its users for political beliefs, the company explicitly says it does conduct background checks on members by looking at public state and county criminal records as well as state and national sex offender registries on US-based users, according to its website,.
It also checks the Office of Foreign Asset Control's list, which includes terrorist designations, and the company also uses approved background check providers.
The company also said in a statement to the BBC it used ""background check processes"" and community input to identify users whose behaviour was ""antithetical to the Airbnb Community Commitment"".
Some Twitter users pointed out that many AirBnB accounts are linked to Facebook accounts, which could allow the company to track those who RSVPd to the rally or similar events.",Organisers behind a white nationalist rally in Virginia are outraged after home-sharing company Airbnb kicked off users affiliated with the event.,40867272
68,"SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon accused Tory counterpart Ruth Davidson of ""talking so much about independence that I can't get a word in edgeways about it"".
But Ms Davidson hit back by telling Ms Sturgeon: ""The country said 'No' and you won't listen to them.""
Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale said people ""want to move on"" from the referendum.
The televised debate, which was hosted by the BBC's Sarah Smith in front of a live audience, also featured Willie Rennie of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, Scottish Green Party co-convener Patrick Harvie and UKIP's David Coburn.
Ms Sturgeon opened the debate by arguing that only her party could protect Scotland from an ""extreme Brexit"".
And she said that supporting the SNP would ""protect Scotland's right to make our own decisions"" with regard to an independence referendum.
The first minister was followed by Ms Davidson, who told Ms Sturgeon that she should: ""Fix our schools, don't split up our country. Champion our businesses, don't put a border at Berwick.""
She added: ""At this election we can send the SNP a message they can't ignore, and with your help we can stop them, and in so doing we can get back to the issues that really matter.""
Ms Sturgeon responded by accusing the Scottish Conservative leader of using independence as a smokescreen for her party's ""toxic"" policies.
She said: ""Ruth Davidson says I talk about nothing else, the truth is she talks so much about independence that I can't get a word in edgeways about it.
""Ruth Davidson is using independence as a smokescreen in this campaign because she knows the Tory record and Tory policies are toxic.""
Ms Dugdale warned the opinion polls were suggesting that the Conservatives ""will be back and they will be more destructive than ever before"" after the election.
She added: ""So who do you want to stand up to the Tories? Labour MPs who understand your life, because they've lived, or SNP MPs who will use every bit of Tory cruelty to exploit the case for independence.""
Mr Rennie said the SNP's focus was ""always independence"", adding: ""It took 44 days for Nicola Sturgeon to publish her Bill on another independence referendum. It took 15 months for them to write their mental health strategy.
""It took two years for us to persuade them to expand nursery education for two-year-olds and it took six years for us to persuade them about a pupil premium.""
Meanwhile, Mr Harvie warned social and environmental rights, guaranteed in the EU, would be ""in the hands of a hard right Tory government hell-bent on a bonfire of the regulations"".
And Mr Coburn used his opening remarks to state that ""UKIP is the party of Brexit. We must elect UKIP to the Commons to ensure Brexit means exit"".
The debate also saw Ms Sturgeon come under fire from the politically balanced audience over the SNP's record on health and education - both of which are devolved to the Scottish Parliament.
One member said she was a nurse and had been forced to use a foodbank.
She said that colleagues were considering leaving nursing, adding: ""You have no idea how demoralising it is to work in the NHS.""
Making a direct plea to the first minister, she said: ""Don't come on your announced visits, come in in the middle of any day to any ward, to any A&E department and see what we're up against.""
Ms Sturgeon told her ""My sister works in the National Health Service, believe me she tells me exactly what she thinks about these matters.""
She said the ""austerity policies"" of the UK government meant public sector workers had had pay rises capped at 1%.
And she stressed that the Scottish government had a policy of no compulsory redundancies in the NHS and wider public sector.
Analysis
By Philip Sim, BBC Scotland political reporter
At times it was like a Thursday session of First Minister's Questions, with the leaders of the main parties trading barbs over a faintly baffling mix of devolved and reserved policies.
With the SNP defending 56 seats, it was natural that the other leaders would target Nicola Sturgeon.
So, the early stages saw Ruth Davidson and Kezia Dugdale attack the SNP's record in government, although the Scottish Tory leader came under sustained pressure herself over immigration.
There were the usual bouts of participants shouting over each other, and but it was notable that Ms Sturgeon came under much more detailed scrutiny than she did during the UK-wide debate on ITV on Thursday.
The first minister is a skilled operator when it comes to this political sparring though, so she held her ground reasonably well; it was a member of the audience who landed the most notable blow on her.
The nurse in the audience who took the first minister to task will go down as the most memorable moment of the debate, and will no doubt be the element which leads tomorrow's headlines.
There were also fierce exchanges between Ms Sturgeon and Ms Davidson over immigration, with the SNP leader arguing that Conservative manifesto pledges to slash net migration to the UK would be ""devastating"" for Scotland's economy.
Calling for politicians to be ""honest"" about immigration, Ms Sturgeon continued: ""When we are talking about migrants here we are talking about people working in our hospitals, people serving us in our restaurants, we are talking about our friends and our neighbours.
""The language around immigration I think is shocking. We have got a need in this country to grow our population.
""If EU migration was to be ended over the next 25 years, or even constrained, we would see our working age population fall while our pensioner-age population is due to go up by 50%. That would be an economic catastrophe.""
Ms Davidson said that ""no one is talking about ending"" migration from the EU, and that it was important that any immigration system was ""trusted"" by people in order to avoid it causing social unrest.
She added: ""What I want to see is Scotland to be the most attractive place so we can attract the brightest and the best. At the moment, despite having a third of the landmass of the UK, and 8.4% of the population, we only attract 4% of immigrants to this country"".
Ms Sturgeon said those figures - which Ms Davidson said were from the UK government - were ""not true"", and instead pointed to National Records of Scotland figures which said the country attracted 7% of migrants to the UK.",Scotland's political leaders have traded blows over independence and immigration in a heated BBC debate.,39995184

The gesture was inspired by Non-League Day, a campaign to encourage supporters of bigger clubs to try local football.
Chairman Keith Mills said: ""If we could attract an extra 20 people through the gate it would make a big difference.""
Last year, Bungay Town gave out punnets of mushrooms in a similar ploy to tempt fans during the international break.
""We're all fighting for the same money,"" Mr Mills said. ""We're a club that's out in the sticks and does well to attract supporters and sponsors, but it all boils down to money unfortunately.""
The average gate at Summer Road, where admission is Â£6 for adults and Â£4 for concessions, is about 80 people.
Seventy-eight people attended Saturday's game, which was up on the last home game, watched by 42 people.
""One of our supporters, Mike Powles, is an egg producer so we asked him if we could give away some eggs,"" Mr Mills said. ""It's a little gimmick but it got people talking.""
Mr Mills hopes the free eggs, which were handed out after the match, will play a small part in spreading the popularity of non-league football, but said more support is also needed from high up.
""There's an enormous amount of money in the professional game and a lot of it is going out of the country, on foreign players,"" he said.
""The England team won't be successful until they support English players at grassroots levels.""

72,"The steam boat Arfon had remained untouched on the bed of the English Channel for almost 100 years until it was discovered in 2014.
The trawler swept mines laid by German U-boats off the Dorset coast until 10 of its 13 crew members died when it struck a mine in April 1917.
The new protection restricts access to the site.
Historic England said the trawler's mine-sweeping gear, deck gun and engine room were still intact on the seabed off St Alban's Head.
But the government heritage agency feared the Arfon, built in Goole, East Yorkshire, in 1908, could be vulnerable to uncontrolled salvage.
The Department for Culture, Media and Sport granted it protection under the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973, which means access to the site is restricted to divers with a licence from Historic England.
Joe Flatman, the body's head of listing programmes, said: ""The Arfon shipwreck is a rare survivor of a type of vessel once very common around the coastline of Britain but which has now entirely disappeared, surviving only in documents and as wrecks like this one.

73,"Using world survey data, the Lancet study authors found life satisfaction followed a predictable trajectory depending on where people lived.
In countries such as the UK and the US, life satisfaction followed a U-shape, dipping to a low in midlife.
In Africa it was low throughout, and in Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union and Latin America it declined with age.
The reasons behind the trends were multiple and complex, but there were some plausible explanations as well as important lessons to be learned, said Prof Andrew Steptoe, of University College London, and colleagues.
Their report is part of a series on health and ageing, published in The Lancet, warning of a growing burden of chronic disease and diminished wellbeing affecting the quality of life of older people.
The researchers used four years of data from the Gallup World Poll in more than 160 countries covering more than 98% of the world's population, to make their evaluations.
As well as physical health and pain, they considered three measures of wellbeing:
In Western world nations, life satisfaction bottomed out between the ages of 45 and 54 before rising again.
Co-researcher Angus Deaton, of Princeton University in the US, said economics could explain this.
""This is the period at which wage rates typically peak and is the best time to work and earn the most, even at the expense of present wellbeing, so as to have increased wealth and wellbeing later in life,"" he said.
It might explain why elderly people were happier despite becoming more frail - although poorer health led to lower ratings of life satisfaction among the elderly, higher life satisfaction seemed to stave off physical health declines.
In transition countries, such as the former Soviet Union, life satisfaction declined steadily with age and was generally lower overall than in the West.
This could again be linked to economics, said the researchers. Older people in these countries had lost a system that, however imperfect, had given meaning to their lives, and, in some cases, their pensions and their health care.
In sub-Saharan Africa, satisfaction was very low throughout life, while stress and worry was high.
""The findings undoubtedly show the recent experiences of the region and the distress that these events have brought to older people,"" said Prof Deaton.
Prof Steptoe said while money did not equate to happiness, economic progress did promote wellbeing to an extent.
""It would appear that wellbeing goes along with economic prosperity in the world,"" he said.","Happiness nose dives as you hit middle age - but only if you live in the affluent West, according to experts.",29899769

The occurrence, known as heteropaternal superfecundation, is rare with few publicly known about.

The US Army declined to comment on the hearing, citing privacy laws, but earlier said such proceedings were a ""common practice"".
On her Twitter account, Manning said she would not be able to use the gym, library or go outdoors for three weeks as punishment.
Manning said the punishment also means she could spend longer in a high-security prison, as it represents a blot against her good behaviour records.
Among the banned items allegedly found in her cell was a tube of expired toothpaste, a copy of Vanity Fair magazine with transgender Caitlyn Jenner (formerly known as Bruce) on the cover and Malala Yousafzai's memoir.

81,"Four helicopters and 20 lorries were destroyed in a series of fires inside the T4 base last week, the images from intelligence company Stratfor suggest.
The cause of the fires is unconfirmed.
The Russian military has denied reports that it had lost helicopters at the base as a result of an IS attack.
A news agency linked to IS, Amaq, was the first to report the incident, without saying what had caused the fires, says BBC Arabic Syria correspondent Rami Ruhayem.
""Burning of four Russian attack helicopters and 20 trucks loaded with missiles inside T4 airport in eastern Homs [province] as a result of a nearby fire,"" it said in an urgent report, leading to speculation that it could have been accidental.
On the same day, IS released an image it said showed one of its fighters firing Grad rockets at T4, also known as Tiyas.
""What the imagery tells us is that first of all this was not an accidental explosion, as some of the rumours kept saying,"" Stratfor military analyst Sim Tack said.
""It shows very clearly that there are several different sources of explosions across the airport, and it shows that the Russians took a quite a bad hit.
""An entire combat helicopter unit was wiped out - four helicopters in total - as well as some damage to some of the Syrian planes on the airport, and also very notably a logistic depot, likely one that was being used to supply those specific combat helicopters.""
Mr Tack described Amaq's account as ""very accurate"", and suggested the helicopters and depot were destroyed by IS attacks.
He said it was unclear why IS had not officially said it had caused the destruction.
""In the past IS has claimed similar attacks, they have even videotaped the attacks themselves.
""In this case, we haven't seen any of those materials come out yet. One possibility is that by making the statement they were intending to claim it while not necessarily phrasing it that way.""
Russian ministry of defence spokesman Igor Konashenkov insisted that ""all Russian combat helicopters in Syrian Arab Republic continue their mission to destroy terrorists. There are no losses among the personnel"".
He said the base had been damaged as a result of fighting between IS militants and Syrian army months before Russian military deployment there.
The area where the airbase is located is strategically significant, Rami Ruhayem says.
The province of Homs stretches out into the Syrian desert towards Raqqa, the capital of the ""caliphate"" proclaimed by IS in 2014, and Deir al-Zour, on the way to the border with Iraq, he notes.
As it tries to shake the government's grip on Homs, IS is facing a diverse range of factions on the ground.
A Kurdish-Arab alliance has announced the launch of a military campaign against IS north of Raqaa.
""With the participation of all SDF [Syrian Democratic Forces] units, we start this operation to liberate northern Raqaa"" province, the SDF said on Twitter, quoting Kurdish commander Rojda Felat.
The assault will be supported by air strikes from the US-led coalition bombing IS in Iraq and Syria, it added.
The Iranian Al-Alam news website carried reports earlier this month that ""Syrian allied forces"" had cut off IS supply lines between Raqqa and Homs by taking over four hills overlooking the Shaer gas fields held by IS.
But Mr Tack counters that IS supply lines to Raqqa are holding.
""The regime and the Russians are facing notable challenges in trying to disconnect those two.
""Right now though, the emphasis seems to be more on moving towards Deir al-Zour rather than messing with Raqqa.""",New satellite imagery appears to reveal extensive damage to a strategically significant airbase in central Syria used by Russian forces after a reported attack by so-called Islamic State (IS).,36368346

83,"Researchers traced the ""microplastic"" back to synthetic clothes, which released up to 1,900 tiny fibres per garment every time they were washed.
Earlier research showed plastic smaller than 1mm were being eaten by animals and getting into the food chain.
The findings appeared in the journal Environmental Science and Technology.
""Research we had done before... showed that when we looked at all the bits of plastic in the environment, about 80% was made up from smaller bits of plastic,"" said co-author Mark Browne, an ecologist now based at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
""This really led us to the idea of what sorts of plastic are there and where did they come from.""
Dr Browne, a member of the US-based research network National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis, said the tiny plastic was a concern because evidence showed that it was making its way into the food chain.
""Once the plastics had been eaten, it transferred from [the animals'] stomachs to their circulation system and actually accumulated in their cells,"" he told BBC News.
In order to identify how widespread the presence of microplastic was on shorelines, the team took samples from 18 beaches around the globe, including the UK, India and Singapore.
""We found that there was no sample from around the world that did not contain pieces of microplastic.""
Dr Browne added: ""Most of the plastic seemed to be fibrous.
""When we looked at the different types of polymers we were finding, we were finding that polyester, acrylic and polyamides (nylon) were the major ones that we were finding.""
The data also showed that the concentration of microplastic was greatest in areas near large urban centres.
In order to test the idea that sewerage discharges were the source of the plastic discharges, the team worked with a local authority in New South Wales, Australia.
""We found exactly the same proportion of plastics,"" Dr Browne revealed, which led the team to conclude that their suspicions had been correct.
As a result, Dr Browne his colleague Professor Richard Thompson from the University of Plymouth, UK carried out a number of experiments to see what fibres were contained in the water discharge from washing machines.
""We were quite surprised. Some polyester garments released more than 1,900 fibres per garment, per wash,"" Dr Browne observed.
""It may not sound like an awful lot, but if that is from a single item from a single wash, it shows how things can build up.
""It suggests to us that a large proportion of the fibres we were finding in the environment, in the strongest evidence yet, was derived from the sewerage as a consequence from washing clothes.""","Microscopic plastic debris from washing clothes is accumulating in the marine environment and could be entering the food chain, a study has warned.",16709045

Despite making a solid start against the Chinese top seeds Zhang Nan and Zhao Yunlei, they were eventually beaten 21-15 21-7.
The Anglo-Scottish pair are ranked 20 in the world and were appearing in their first major final.
""Unfortunately they were a bit more experienced,"" Adcock told BBC Sport.
Zhang and Zhao's victory gave China their fifth gold medal of the championships.
Of the 21 other British players who entered this year, none made it past Wednesday's matches.
Neither Leicester-born Adcock, 22, nor Scottish 23-year-old Bankier, had ever come close to an international result of this magnitude at senior level.
They surpassed all expectations by defeating the eighth, fourth and second seeds en route to the final.
The British couple went toe-to-toe with the Chinese early on in the final as Bankier's confident net play disrupted their opponents' play.
A powerful smash by Adcock drew the British pair level at 15-15 and they looked on course to cause another upset.
But a series of mis-hits and errors allowed Zhang and Zhao to take control.
""The first set was absolutely crucial,"" Adcock told BBC Sport. ""We were playing well until 15-15. It's where we've been strong all week, closing out matches and performing in tight situations.
""We've won a silver world medal and I see it as a stepping stone to winning the medal above. We can only use it as a positive.""
By the second set, the Chinese had found their form and looked comfortable dealing with the British attack.
In front of a boisterous Wembley crowd, Adcock and Bankier struggled to cope with the Chinese duo's dominance as they fell 15-6 behind and the world's top pair soon clinched victory.
Bankier told BBC Sport: ""It's hard to end the tournament on a loss when we've been on a high all week. But, when we reflect, we've produced some fantastic performances and had brilliant results against top 10 pairs.""
This was the first appearance by Britons in a World Badminton final since Athens Olympic silver medallists Nathan Robertson and Gail Emms won the mixed doubles world title in 2006.
Five years on from that success, Robertson drifted out of the tournament alongside new partner Jenny Wallwork on its third day.
That pairing - seeded 10th - had been billed as Britain's likeliest chance of a medal, but unseeded Adcock and Bankier appeared inspired by their status as last Brits standing.

After its removal from the building near Carlisle College and restoration, it will go on display in Workington.
The tram was built in the early 20th Century and its last journey took place in Carlisle in the 1930s.
Before being moved into the building, it was believed to have been stood for many years as a garden shed.
The remains of the tram is mostly the framework of the lower saloon.
Phil Tuer, from the Workington Transport Heritage Trust, said restoring the tram was not going to be easy.
He said: ""It's in a very sorry state of repair and requires a large amount of work to be carried out.""
Alistair Grey is the secretary of the trust and says that the door to the building is smaller than the door that was on it when the tram was originally moved there.
He said: ""Dragging the tram out will be a tight squeeze.
""It's been in the building for many years and the pigeons have left layers of muck that needs cleaning up.""
Mr Grey said it could cost up to £15,000 to restore the remains of the tram.

Officers found his body in a mummified state, the inquest heard. His wife was also living at the house.

Officers who spoke to the vicar's wife decided she was unwell and took her to hospital.
The inquest in Llangefni was told that in interviews Pauline Bevan described how her husband had a heart attack in November 2010.
Dewi Pritchard Jones, senior coroner for North West Wales, said there had been problems identifying the body.
A DNA comparison with the cleric's brother only gave a partial match because of the poor quality of the sample.
The coroner said he was satisfied the body was that of Dr Bevan who, on the balance of probabilities, died of heart disease.
Mr Pritchard-Jones said: ""Neighbours had commented to a police officer that they hadn't seen the Rev Basil Bevan for some time and there was concern regarding his welfare.

98,"The draft guidelines for England say women predisposed to breast cancer because of a strong family history of the disease need this protection.
There are now three drugs to choose from - tamoxifen, raloxifene and, for the first time, anastrozole.
Anastrozole is cheaper than the other two and, for some women, has fewer side-effects and is more effective.
Trials show that per 1,000 patients taking anastrozole for five years, 35 cancer cases would be prevented compared with 21 for tamoxifen.
Which treatment is best for each woman will depend on her situation. If she is pre-menopausal, anastrozole won't be suitable because it knocks out the female hormone oestrogen, creating, in effect, a drug-induced menopause.
Clinical trials show anastrozole avoids two of tamoxifen's more serious side-effects - an increased risk of developing a blood-clotting disease, and an increased risk of developing womb cancer.
But anastrozole can make bones weaker and so it is not recommended for women with osteoporosis.
Women should discuss the relative merits and risks with their doctor when deciding which tablet to take.
Prof Mark Baker from NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) said: ""Our draft guideline update recommends the use of anastrozole as a first-line treatment for post-menopausal women at high or medium risk of breast cancer who don't have osteoporosis.
""The evidence examined by the committee suggests anastrozole will not only reduce the number of breast cancer cases in these women compared to tamoxifen, but it is also a more cost-effective option.""
Anastrozole costs about 4p a pill. The list price of tamoxifen is about 9p per tablet.
Baroness Morgan from the charity, Breast Cancer Now, was concerned that patients might not be able to access treatments, despite the recommendations.
Not all of the tablets are licensed for use as breast cancer prevention drugs. Doctors can still prescribe them off-label.
""This updated guideline is a great first step but we now need to ensure that these risk-reducing options actually make their way to patients that could benefit. Ultimately, if the full potential of anastrozole is to be realised for post-menopausal women, there needs to be far greater awareness and support for GPs in prescribing off-label treatments.""
Some women find that the side-effects of these breast cancer pills are significant enough to stop them taking the medication.
Common side-effects, affecting at least one in every 10 women on the tablets, include hot flushes and sweats.
Breast cancer affects one in eight women in the UK. Most cases are not linked to a family history.
Around 5% of people diagnosed with breast cancer have inherited a faulty BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene.
If you have a faulty gene, it doesn't mean you'll definitely develop breast cancer, but you are at higher risk.
Out of every 100 women with a faulty gene, between 40 and 85 will develop breast cancer in their lifetime.

The only problem is that David Cameron wants to delay the start of exit talks until a new Conservative leader has been elected in October.
That would give the new prime minister the chance to work out his or her negotiating strategy and get it endorsed by the House of Commons in a vote - and perhaps even the people in a general election.
But Derrick Wyatt QC, emeritus professor of law at Oxford University, told me that Mr Cameron might not have as much time as he had expected.
He said that the European Council - representing the 27 other member states - could trigger the negotiating process as soon as the prime minister discusses Brexit with other EU leaders.
Paragraph two of Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty says that ""a Member State which decides to withdraw shall notify the European Council of its intention"".
Once this happens, the leaving state has up to two years to negotiate a withdrawal agreement.
The treaty does not say how this process of notification should happen.
It has always been assumed that this would come in the form of a letter from the prime minister to Donald Tusk, the European Council president, and the timing would be in the hands of the British government.
Prof Wyatt, who has represented clients in hundreds of cases before the European courts, said that EU lawyers might consider any discussion about Brexit between Mr Cameron and Mr Tusk and other EU leaders as effectively notifying the European Council of the UK's intention to leave.
Prof Wyatt said: ""If David Cameron attends the European council on Tuesday, he is likely to confirm in discussions with other heads of government that the UK intends to leave the EU.
""He might do this directly in so many words or he might conduct conversations predicated on the UK's departure from the EU, such as suggestions that informal pre-negotiations might take place before Article 50 is formally triggered.
""EU lawyers might advise the council that such confirmation or such conversations are themselves enough to trigger Article 50 and set the clock ticking on the two year period for negotiating a withdrawal agreement.""
But a European Council spokesman reiterated on Saturday that triggering Article 50 was a formal act which must be ""done by the British government to the European Council"".
""It has to be done in an unequivocal manner with the explicit intent to trigger Article 50,"" the spokesman said.
""It could either be a letter to the president of the European Council or an official statement at a meeting of the European Council duly noted in the official records of the meeting.""
This question is crucial because the sooner Article 50 is triggered, the less time the UK will have to secure a withdrawal deal.
The closer the UK gets to the two-year deadline, the weaker its negotiating position.
The two-year period can be extended but only with the agreement of all EU member states and they would demand concessions from the UK before giving that agreement.
Leave campaigners have long argued that the government should delay triggering Article 50 until substantial pre-negotiation talks have taken place between the UK and the EU. But Prof Wyatt's interpretation of the EU treaty suggests this would be difficult.
Any decision by the EU to trigger the Article 50 process before the UK is ready would be considered a hostile act by the British government and would be a high-risk strategy for EU leaders.
The UK might try to challenge the decision in the European Court of Justice, which decides how EU treaties should be interpreted.

Under a peace agreement signed late last year all weapons had to be surrendered to the UN by Tuesday.
Farc commanders had argued that they could not meet the original deadline because of delays in building special camps to house demobilised fighters.
According to the deal, which was reached after four years of talks in Cuba, about 7,000 fighters in 26 transition zones were to have handed their arms to the UN by 30 May.
""In a joint agreement with the United Nations and the Farc, we have agreed that the arms hand-over will not end tomorrow as had been planned, but instead within 20 days,"" Mr Santos said on Monday.
""The change in date does not in any way affect the firm decision and clear commitment of the government and the Farc to comply with the accord.""
President Santos also said that the time that the rebels would be allowed to stay in the demobilisation camps would be extended to 1 August.
After that, all fighters must start their reintegration process into civil society.
Earlier this month, the first group to complete the disarmament process received certificates from the UN mission at a ceremony in Bogota..

""The club have made clear that they want to see progression on the pitch,"" says a club statement.
West Ham's announcement follows an end-of-season meeting between Allardyce and the club's board.

It added that the club expects a top 10 finish in the table.
The statement continued: ""After listening to feedback from supporters, the board have insisted on improvements to the set-up of the playing and backroom staff to ensure the team provides more entertainment next season.
""The manager has agreed to recruit a new attacking coach to complement the existing coaching set-up as well as an overhaul of the club's scouting and recruitment operation.
""That will see the board have a greater involvement in the players who are signed, as the board will once again be investing considerable funds into the club this summer.
""The club have made clear that they want to see progression on the pitch and at least a top 10 finish as a result.""
Allardyce took charge at Upton Park three years ago after the Hammers had been relegated from the Premier League under Avram Grant.
He led West Ham to promotion via the Championship play-offs in his first season before securing 10th place in 2012-13.

107,"A review by the Children's Commissioner also found that 13% with life-threatening conditions were not allowed specialist support.
She said the system was ""playing Russian roulette"" with their health.
NHS England said it was ""clearly the case"" that services need to expand.
The commissioner obtained data from 48 of England's 60 child and adolescent mental health service trusts, and discovered 28% of child referrals were denied specialist treatment - mostly on the grounds that their illness was not serious enough.
This group included children who had attempted serious self-harm and those with psychosis and anorexia nervosa.
It also found that those who secured treatment faced lengthy delays, with an average waiting time of more than 100 days.
Ellie Fogden, now 19, sought help when she was 16:
I did not become ill immediately at 16.  For a number of years, I felt quite down, so to speak. It was constant worrying, pressure from school, and my own body image.
I got to a point where I had had enough. I am waking up every day and I am not wanting to be here.
I self-referred to a local counselling service and I was on a waiting list for about three months and then started sessions. The counsellor was very worried and she referred me to CAMHs.
It took about three to four weeks to get a session. I was in there for about three hours and I was just bombarded with questions.
I wasn't taken seriously enough. Some of the questions were dismissed as - it is not that bad, people have it worse. There was no compassion.
I didn't go back for another CAMHs appointment. It frightened the living daylights out of me.
As I have grown older, it has just gone into a downward spiral where I am currently worse than I was when I was 16, with depression.
Children's Commissioner Anne Longfield told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that she had heard from a ""constant stream of children, parents and professionals"" about their inability to get help when they really need it.
They go to their GP who refers them to specialists, but the specialists then say their conditions are not serious enough, she said.
""I don't yet know quite why they are being turned away, but certainly being turned away or put on a waiting list for up to six months is clearly playing Russian roulette with their health,"" she added.
The average waiting time for those accepted for support ranged from 14 days in a trust in north-west England to 200 days at one in the West Midlands.
More than a third of trusts, around 35%, said they would restrict access to services for children who missed appointments.
Ms Longfield said trusts have told her there was ""too much demand"" for their services.
""There is more awareness, more people coming forward for help,"" she said.
But Sarah Brennan, from mental health charity Young Minds, said: ""Services have been cut and young people had no where to go.
""They are then more ill when they get help so services have become overwhelmed... Six months for a young person is huge and in that time most young people are becoming more ill.""
Natasha Devon, formerly the government's mental health champion, said in order to identify problems in the early stages, it was necessary to look at the root causes.
""Anxiety, for example, is the fastest growing illness in under-21s, and we need to look at what's happening to young people - the culture and the society they live in, the pressures that are on them.""
James Morris, the Conservative MP who is chair of the all-party group on mental health, acknowledged that problems had been building up in the system over many years and a ""fundamental transformation"" was required.
""We do need to move towards a more compassionate system for children and young people but the transformation is going to take time,"" he told the Today programme.
""It's going to require additional investment, better commissioning on the ground.""
An NHS England spokesman said: ""While the data in this report des not substantiate the conclusions drawn, it is clearly the case that CAMHs services need to expand and the additional Â£1.4bn pledged will help us to do that.""
In March, the Mental Health Network, which represents mental health trusts, said it had seen ""no significant investment"" in psychiatric services for children in England.
It said it suspects some of the money allocated has been used to support other NHS services instead.
A Department for Health spokesman said: ""This investment is just beginning and is creating new joined up plans to improve care in the community and schools to make sure young people get support before they reach a crisis point.""","More than a quarter of children referred to mental health services in England in 2015 - including some who had attempted suicide - received no help, a report says.",36398247
108,"""Sexual harassment is commonplace, girls' appearance is intensively scrutinised and their abilities are undermined,"" says the report.
The report Equality for Girls is based on a survey of more than 1,200 girls and young women aged seven to 21.
Girlguiding chief executive Julie Bentley called it a ""wake-up call"".
She said: ""This cannot be dismissed as something that girls and young women just have to deal with as they grow up.""
Girls needed to live in an equal society if they were to flourish and fulfil their potential to be leaders in all walks of life, added Ms Bentley.
The survey of a representative sample of girls and young women, both Guides and non-Guides, gives ""a disturbing insight into the state of equality for girls in the UK"", says Girlguiding, which has more than half a million members.
""Girls identified sexism as a priority issue for their generation"", with three-quarters saying sexism affected ""most areas of their lives"", says the report.
Of the 11 to 21-year-olds questioned, some 87% thought women were judged more on their appearance than their ability.
More than a third (36%) of all those surveyed had felt ""patronised or made to feel stupid"" because of their gender, rising to 60% of the 16 to 21-year-olds.
Most of the 13-year-olds questioned said they had experienced sexual harassment, rising to 80% of 19 to 21-year-olds.
This included being shouted and whistled at, sexual graffiti and pornography, sexual jokes and taunts as well as unwanted sexual attention, unwanted touching and stalking.
More than three-quarters (78%) said they found this behaviour threatening if they were alone.
The girls said there were ""clear double standards"" for girls and boys when it came to relationships and sex.
Three-quarters (76%) of the 11 to 21-year-olds said girls were judged harshly for sexual behaviour seen as acceptable in boys, with just 3% feeling the opposite.
Most of the 16 to 21-year-olds questioned said they thought too much responsibility was placed on girls for their sexual safety.
The report also talks of bias in the way women are portrayed in the media, with girls and women facing ""unprecedented levels of personal and public scrutiny"" over body shape"".
Of the 11 to 21-year-olds questioned, 75% agreed boys expected girls to look like images they saw in the media, while 71% said they would like to lose weight.
Other challenges are similar to those faced by previous generations, such as overcoming stereotypes and constraints in work and family life, say the authors.
Some 46% of the 11 to 21-year-olds said they feared having children would damage their careers. Most of the 16 to 21-year-olds worried some employers may to some extent prefer to hire men.
The report concludes that despite awareness of the difficulties they face, most girls remain positive, with 55% hoping to get to the top of their chosen profession, 70% wanting to combine a career and motherhood and 11% preferring a career over children.
Lucy Lawrenson, 18, of Girlguiding, said she was ""depressed"" by the findings.
""Issues that should only be read about in our history books are still common.
""I know because they happen to me, and this can't continue. Something has to change.""
Emma Gees, 22, also of Girlguiding, said cultural misconceptions and media stereotypes ""deeply ingrained in our culture"" were major barriers to equality.
""Equality requires a change in perception and attitudes, not just laws, which is currently the case,"" she said.
Kelley Temple, National Union of Students women's officer, said the report echoed new NUS research into lad culture at universities.
""It's time decision-makers across the spectrum woke up to the realities of gender inequality,"" she said.
""We need to take action to tackle this culture within our communities that cuts women out whenever it rears its ugly head.""
Girlguiding plans to meet the leaders of the main political parties in the run-up to the general election in 2015 to discuss the findings.","Sexism is so widespread in the UK that it affects ""most aspects"" of the lives of girls and young women, a report from Girlguiding says.",25138455
109,"This might lead some teens to underestimate the need for healthier diets and exercise, researchers warn.
But they say there is some good news - most normal-weight teenagers recognised their weight was fine.
The study, funded by the charity Cancer Research UK, appears in the International Journal of Obesity.
Over the last few decades, studies in adults have hinted that fewer people are able to spot when they are overweight.
And scientists speculate that the rising levels of obesity across the population might have ""normalised"" the idea of being overweight or obese, making it harder to recognise the extra pounds.
But others argue that a constant barrage of media and cultural messages encouraging people to be thin might lead some to overestimate their weight.
To see how this might affect teenagers, the researchers looked at nearly 5,000 adolescents aged between 13 and 15.
They used data collected from the Health Survey for England spanning 2005-2012, which included the following question.
""Given your age and height, would you say that you are about the right weight, too heavy or too light?""
Separately, researchers recorded teenagers' heights and weights and calculated their body mass index - a ratio of weight to height.
Their responses were then compared against categories of BMI.
Eight out of 10 teenagers of normal weight according to the BMI measure, identified themselves as about the right weight.
But there were differences between sexes, with normal-weight girls more likely to consider themselves as too heavy.
And in adolescents whose weight put them in the overweight category, 39% said they were about the right weight.
Researchers say their results bring up challenging questions about how best to tackle weight in teenagers, without causing unnecessary concern in those whose weight is healthy.
Prof Jane Wardle, from the Cancer Research UK Health Behaviour Research Centre at University College London, said: ""This study was a cause for celebration and concern.
""Young people who think they're overweight when they're not can sometimes develop devastating eating disorders, so we're delighted that most of the normal-weight teenagers had a realistic view of their body size.
""But we need to find effective ways of helping too-heavy teenagers slim down and maintain a healthier weight, and it is vitally important that we find out whether it helps if they are more aware of their weight status.""
Eustace De Sousa, at Public Health England, said a healthy weight could help protect against disease in later life.
He added: ""Children and teenagers consume more sugar than anyone else, so cutting back and being more active will help to maintain a healthy weight and protect against developing type 2 diabetes, heart disease and some cancers later in life.""","More than a third of overweight teenagers do not regard themselves as too heavy and think they are about the right weight, a study in England shows.",33453456

It had been criticised for its images of smiling slaves, and described as being ""highly problematic"".
Scholastic said in a statement that without more historical context, the book ""may give a false impression of the reality of the lives of slaves"".
The book, telling the story of Hercules and Delia making a cake together, had been released on 5 January.
It was met with a barrage of one-star reviews on Amazon, with readers describing it as ""disgustingly inaccurate"", and one writing: ""I can't believe people are celebrating a children's story that depicts happy, joyful slaves.""
Scholastic's description of the story had read: ""Everyone is buzzing about the president's birthday! Especially George Washington's servants, who scurry around the kitchen preparing to make this the best celebration ever.
""Oh, how George Washington loves his cake! And, oh, how he depends on Hercules, his head chef, to make it for him. Hercules, a slave, takes great pride in baking the president's cake.""
Author Ramin Ganeshram and illustrator Vanessa Brantley-Newton had written about the historical context in notes accompanying the story, but were criticised for not having included it in the main narrative.
Trade journal Kirkus said children could be left with a ""sorely incomplete understanding of both the protagonists' lives and slavery itself"" if adults did not read them the additional material.
Scholastic said in the statement: ""While we have great respect for the integrity and scholarship of the author, illustrator, and editor, we believe that, without more historical background on the evils of slavery than this book for younger children can provide, the book may give a false impression of the reality of the lives of slaves and therefore should be withdrawn.""
They added that they ""do not believe this title meets the standards of appropriate presentation of information to younger children, despite the positive intentions and beliefs of the author, editor, and illustrator.""
Ganeshram wrote in a blog post that she had undertaken four years of research and ""thought long and hard about each word and depiction"".
""How could they be proud to bake a cake for George Washington? The answers to those questions are complex because human nature is complex.
""Bizarrely and yes, disturbingly, there were some enslaved people who had a better quality of life than others and 'close' relationships with those who enslaved them. But they were smart enough to use those 'advantages' to improve their lives.""
Editor Andrea Davis Pinkney said in her own blog post on the subject that while ""the topic of slavery is one that must be handled with the utmost care"", the book ""presents an important slice of American history"".
She wrote: ""A Birthday Cake for George Washington does not take slavery's horror for granted.

IndyCar said in a statement that Bourdais was ""awake and alert"", had not lost consciousness in the accident and had been taken to Indianapolis Memorial Hospital for evaluation.
Drivers are supposed to get several attempts at setting a time on the first day of qualifying at Indy but a rain storm in the morning delayed running and in the end the session was cut short so that each driver only had one four-lap attempt.

His car veered onto the wrong side of the road and hit a hire car driven by Mrs Vaillant's husband, Louis.
Judge Lady Rae told File he had left a family in ""deep mourning"".
The High Court in Glasgow heard how he had been travelling to Scotland in a Dodge Caliber when the crash took place.
Mr Vaillant, a businessman who lives near Ottawa, was driving south with his wife of 35 years after a visit to St Andrews.
In evidence he said File's car struck his car without warning.

The harbour ultimately owns the land in the area and it is leased to Titanic Quarter Ltd (TQL) under a ""master agreement.""
On Wednesday, TQL's barrister said the agreement is not written in the ""language of veto"", but aimed at finding consensus.
TQL has previously said it was having difficulties advancing new projects with Belfast Harbour under the master agreement.
It described these difficulties as ""the most significant impediment to the group's future progress"".
A temporary exhibition centre was opened at Titanic Quarter last year, but a number of other projects have not been started despite having planning permission.
Those include two film studios which received permission in August 2014.
TQL and the harbour are asking a judge to rule on the correct interpretation of the master agreement.
Under its terms, TQL can bring forward development proposals for agreement with the harbour.
A barrister for the harbour, said his client's only obligation was to consider such proposals in ""good faith"", but could choose to reject them without explaining why.
He said TQL was attempting to ""magic"" a limited agreement into ""an overarching obligation.""
Lawyers for TQL said the firm has never claimed there was a ""compulsion"" for the harbour to agree.

116,"As a Singaporean journalist with the BBC, it's been a privilege to cover many stories about my country over the years. But here was probably its biggest story, garnering the most global attention, that I was missing entirely as I spend two weeks working in London. I've had to watch the events of his death unfold, and my fellow Singaporeans grieving from afar.
But my anguish isn't just professional, it is also personal. As a Singaporean growing up in the 1970s and 80s under Lee Kuan Yew, the influence he had on my life and the lives of many millions of Singaporeans has been immense. The story has been told a million times, how with a tight grip on power, he and his team took a small third world country with limited natural resources and turned it one of the world's wealthiest countries per capita in a generation.
But what was it like growing up as that transformation took place?
Even as children, we were aware of the constant change, not just externally, with the nation's skyline, its factories and rivers, but also internally.  Campaigns spearheaded by Mr Lee's government sought to micromanage our behaviour. From courtesy to anti-spitting campaigns, Singaporeans were taught from a young age how to be compliant.
When we were older, we were told how many children we should have and even whom to marry. As graduates, you were encouraged to marry someone with the same level of education, to make real Mr Lee's vision of social engineering and becoming a nation producing smarter babies.
Watching the thousands throng the streets - first to show their respects to his coffin at Parliament House and then to watch his funeral motorcade go by in a tropical downpour - made me think at first that here at work was the same thing: compliance, from a nation so accustomed to doing as he said. The alternative often meant being sued, or thrown into detention without trial. Most Singaporeans traded up personal freedoms for economic success.
But here at work was something more. Tears and emotions were high, not just in Singapore but for the many Singaporeans living overseas. My extended family, many of whom have emigrated to the US and Canada, spent days debating his legacy on our family group on WhatsApp. If he was having that impact on them, years after they left their country, imagine what sort of influence his death still wielded on many millions more.
It's hard to put in words the effect he had. For many, including myself, it was a love-hate relationship. Love for the immense transformation his governance brought to Singapore. How it's now admired as a nation to be emulated by giants such as India, which has Singapore building a new city for it, and China, which had President Xi Jinping dispatching generals to live there to study its model of governance. Being Singaporean makes me hold my orange-red passport proud at immigration lines worldwide.
But hate for the way his executed the transformation, depriving many of free speech, a two-party state, their native Chinese dialects and, if you were a man, the freedom to wear your hair long, get out of military conscription and love a member of the same sex. And then there's the ban on chewing gum that many foreigners seem to delight in pointing out.
Mr Lee's influence spanned well over the 31 years that he actually governed. As a senior minister and then ""minister mentor"" - titles he took after standing down as prime minister in 1990 - his counsel was regularly sought by Singapore's next generation of leaders, including the current leader, his son, Lee Hsien Loong.
Such a cult of personality has been built around Lee Kuan Yew's intelligence and vision that continuing on as a successful nation almost seems impossible without him.
It's made me nervous about the Singapore I shall find when I return, stepping through the comfortable gates of Changi Airport in a little over a week's time. A Singapore without Lee Kuan Yew.",Watching the reaction to Lee Kuan Yew's death from overseas has been a surreal and difficult experience.,32106237
117,"Cyprus's banks, which have been shut all week to prevent mass withdrawals, are to stay closed until next Tuesday.
Politicians have been scrambling to find a way forward after an unpopular levy on bank deposits was rejected by parliament on Tuesday.
The European Central Bank has warned it may halt emergency funding on Monday.
The tax on bank deposits, which provoked street protests, is required for a 10bn-euro (Â£8.5bn; $13bn) EU-IMF loan.
""A decision on a Cyprus rescue must be made on Thursday at the latest,"" said President Nicos Anastasiades, quoted by the official CNA news agency.
Mr Anastasiades is putting a proposal to party leaders. It is then expected to go before parliament in the afternoon, according to CNA.
State TV said the plan might include a levy on bank deposits over 100,000 euros.
The previous proposals had also included a levy on deposits between 20,000 and 100,000 euros, which had outraged many Cypriots.
The new plan is also reported to involve nationalising pension funds.
Adding to the pressure, the European Central Bank (ECB) has warned that it will continue providing emergency funding for Cypriot banks until Monday, but no longer - unless there is a bailout deal to ensure that the banks can be made financially viable.
One official told the Associated Press that the new Cypriot plan would include ""some form"" of Russian help, but did not elaborate.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has scorned the eurozone's bailout plan for Cyprus, accusing EU leaders of behaving ""like a bull in a china shop"".
In Moscow on Thursday he told European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso that all interested parties, including Russia, should be included in a deal for Cyprus.
The Cypriot Finance Minister Michalis Sarris is in Moscow for a second day to negotiate assistance from Russia, which has multi-billion dollar investments in Cyprus.
Mr Sarris said after talks on Wednesday with Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov that there had been ""no offers, nothing concrete,"" but ""a good beginning"".
Cyprus has attracted money through its low tax rates, with Russians holding between a third and a half of all Cypriot deposits.

Cyprus: Mounting EU pressure
Russian private and corporate assets in Cypriot banks are believed to total about 23bn euro, including many larger deposits, and Russian officials had expressed anger at the bank levy plans.
Analysts say Russia may provide more funding in return for interests in Cyprus' offshore energy fields.
The controversial bank levy had been proposed as a condition for the 10bn-euro bailout. Cyprus was expected to raise 5.8bn euros through the one-off tax on bank savings.
In total Cyprus has been told to find 7bn euros, to make the international loan sustainable for its small economy. In addition to the 5.8bn, Cyprus has to get revenue from privatisations, a capital gains tax increase and a 2.5% increase in the corporate tax rate, currently at 10%, to bring in a total of 7bn euros.
Monday 25 March is a scheduled bank holiday in Cyprus, and Thursday and Friday have now also been declared bank holidays. The stock exchange also remains closed.
Bank mergers, a bond issue, and more Russian funding have all been mentioned as ways to help the country out of the crisis.

One offer of help has come from Cyprus's Orthodox Church, which is a major shareholder in the third-largest domestic lender, the Hellenic Bank.
Archbishop Chrysostomos I said on Wednesday the Church was willing to mortgage its assets to invest in government bonds.
The establishment of a ""bad bank"" which would take on risky assets held by Cypriot banks has also been mentioned by officials.
The BBC's Mark Lowen, in Nicosia, says Cyprus is a resilient nation and the banks are still giving out cash through machines - although with limits, and some are running low.
Some businesses are now refusing credit card payments, our correspondent reports.
On Wednesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she regretted but respected the Cypriot vote.
She said the eurozone had a duty to find a solution for Cyprus, but added that the country's current banking system was ""not sustainable"".
Cyprus' banks were left exposed following the debt crisis in Greece and there are fears Cyprus could go bankrupt if they fail.
The bank levy plan was altered on Tuesday to exempt savers with less than 20,000 euros, but a 6.75% charge on deposits of 20,000-100,000 euros and a 9.9% charge for those above 100,000 euros remained.
However, parliament rejected the deal, with 36 MPs voting against it, 19 abstaining and none in favour.","The president of Cyprus is meeting political leaders to hammer out a ""Plan B"" to shore up debt-laden banks - a condition for securing a huge bailout.",21870801
118,"The protest on 9 February was over the 2013 hanging of Kashmiri man Mohammed Afzal Guru and allegedly saw the chanting of anti-India slogans.
Police arrested JNU student union head Kanhaiya Kumar on sedition charges but also named five other organisers.
The arrest led to protests and clashes in Delhi and universities across India.
Government ministers have refused to back down and vowed to punish what they describe as ""anti-national elements"", but critics condemned the charges as an assault on freedom of expression.
The five students - named as Umar Khalid, Anirban Bhattacharya, Ashutosh Kumar, Anant Prakash Narayan, Riyazul Haq and Rama Naga - went missing after they were named by police.
They returned to campus late on Sunday night and addressed other students holding a vigil, reports said.
A section of the media had accused Umar Khalid of having links with the Pakistan-based Islamist militant group Jaish-e-Mohammad, although the government later denied the reports.
""...I'm not a terrorist. I have never projected myself as a Muslim while doing politics on campus. I always tried to see exploitation of Muslims along with the exploitation faced by Dalits, tribals and others,"" Mr Khalid told a gathering.
After news of the students return, police turned up at the JNU campus, Press Trust of India said, but reports say they need permission from university authorities to enter and arrest the students.
At one of Mr Kumar's court appearances, he was set upon by a group of lawyers, an act which further inflamed public opinion.
The protests triggered by the arrest and treatment of Mr Kumar spread far and wide with students from the southern city of Chennai (Madras) and in the eastern city of Kolkata (Calcutta) involved in violent clashes.
Afzal Guru was executed over a 2001 plot to attack India's parliament - charges he always denied. The attack was carried out by Kashmiri militants and left 14 people dead.
His 2013 hanging sparked protests in Kashmir, and he was seen as a martyr and a symbol of perceived injustice. But many of India's politicians were angered when reports surfaced of anti- India slogans chanted at the protest held to mark his execution.
Correspondents say there has been a sharp rise in the number of sedition cases in recent years and many students see the latest moves as an attack on their right to dissent.","Five Indian students facing charges of sedition after organising a protest at Delhi's prestigious Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), have resurfaced.",35628170

Amiri disappeared in Saudi Arabia in 2009 and resurfaced a year later in the US, where he claimed to have been abducted and interrogated by the CIA.
He subsequently returned to Iran and was given a long prison sentence.
News of his execution emerged on Saturday, when Amiri's mother said the body had been handed over with rope marks around his neck.
On Sunday a spokesman for Iranian judiciary, Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei, told reporters: ""Through his connection with the United States, Amiri gave vital information about the country to the enemy,""
Amiri, who was born in 1977, went missing after taking a pilgrimage to Mecca.
After reappearing in the US in 2010, he said he had been kidnapped and put under ""intense psychological pressure to reveal sensitive information"".
However US officials at the time said Amiri had defected of his own accord and provided ""useful information"".
He initially returned to Tehran to a hero's welcome, but was later arrested and tried for treason.

121,"The male bird, which was raised in a nest in Fife last year, was fitted with a satellite tag before it could fly.
Police have made searches of Aberdeenshire's North Glenbuchat Estate where the eagle was last tracked to.
The owners of the North Glenbuchat estate are yet to respond to inquiries from BBC Scotland.
Police officers have spent the day searching property on the estate.
A Police Scotland spokesman said: ""We are concerned for the welfare of a white tailed eagle and enquiries are ongoing to locate the bird.
""Around April 10, 2014, we became aware that the bird was missing from the Glenbuchat area of Strathdon as there were no further recordings from its transmitter.
""There is concern for the welfare of this very rare bird.
""As a result searches have been carried out in the area on both land and within premises.""
In recent years, several satellite tagged golden eagles have also disappeared in the Strathdon area.
In 2011, the body of one of the birds was recovered at Glenbuchat. Tests showed it had been poisoned.
RSPB Scotland's Head of Investigations, Ian Thomson, said: ""The disappearance of this white tailed eagle is very depressing, and particularly so since it joins a list of other satellite-tagged eagles that have vanished on the grouse moors of upper Donside in the last few years.
""It is significant that the only carcass found was that of an illegally poisoned golden eagle back in 2011.
""A police follow-up to that incident, on this same estate, found a poison bait, a poisoned buzzard and a shot short-eared owl.
""Four other satellite-tagged golden eagles have disappeared in the same area, without trace or further transmissions from the tag, in the last five years. This area has become a black hole for eagles"".
In 2006, the then head gamekeeper on the North Glenbuchat Estate, Hector McNeil, was fined Â£850 at Aberdeen Sheriff Court after being convicted of poisoning wild birds and possessing an illegal pesticide.
In June last year, BBC Scotland revealed police were investigating the alleged destruction of a white tailed eagle nest in Angus.
It was thought to be the first nest to be built by white tailed eagles in the east of the country, following a reintroduction programme.
Police Scotland have asked anyone who was in the Glenbuchat area around 10 April and who may have any information to contact them by dialling 101.
The last British white-tailed eagle was shot in Shetland in 1918.
Since the 1970s, the species has been reintroduced to the west coast of Scotland.
Over the past six years, the focus has switched to bringing back the bird on Scotland's east coast.
More than 80 birds, taken from nests in Norway, have been released from a secret location in Fife.
The reintroduction project is run by RSPB Scotland, Scottish Natural Heritage and Forestry Commission Scotland.
It has cost Â£452,000 to date, with funding coming from the RSPB, SNH and the Heritage Lottery Fund.",Police have searched an estate after the disappearance of the first white-tailed sea eagle to be raised in the east of Scotland in almost 200 years.,27142843

However, there was a mixed picture in terms of firms' optimism.
It was in negative territory in retail and wholesale and tourism, but finance and business services had the most positive outlook since the end of 2014.
SCC's quarterly economic indicator suggested tourism sales revenues fell across the board for the second consecutive quarter, despite an increase in customer numbers. Investment and employment also declined over the quarter.
More than a third (36%) of retail and wholesale businesses reported falling optimism, with declines in cash flow, sales employment, profitability and capacity.
The construction sector reported a slight weakening in performance, with optimism falling to its lowest level since the third quarter of 2014.
Despite this, a quarter of the construction firms who responded said they were hiring staff, although they continued to face recruitment difficulties.
The financial and business services sector reported its highest levels of optimism since the final quarter of 2014.
The report suggested this could reflect the fact that more than a third of oil and gas businesses were now more positive about the future.
Meanwhile, the manufacturing sector reported growing optimism after a mixed year in 2016.
Domestic orders and sales revenues were flat but firms said their performance had been boosted by strong export sales.
The report also found positive signs for jobs in manufacturing, with about 87% of respondents indicating employment had either increased or remained the same over the quarter.
However, 45.5% reported difficulties in recruiting, particularly technical/skilled staff.
SCC economic advisory group chairman Neil Amner said the political situation with Brexit, a general election and moves for a second Scottish independence referendum were creating ""uncertainty"".

In it, Mr Davies expressed concern about the long jail sentences for violating the lese majeste law.
Those convicted of insulting the king, queen, heir or regent face up to 15 years in jail on each count.
Two people were recently given sentences of 28 and 30 years each for comments posted on Facebook.
Mr Davies' speech on 25 November at the club's premises in Bangkok touched on a broad range of topics, including King Bhumibol Adulyadej, whom he praised.
He said the US was concerned about the ""lengthy and unprecedented prison sentences handed down by military courts"" in lese majeste cases, and stated the US view that no-one should be jailed for peacefully expressing their views.
Mr Davies has diplomatic immunity from arrest. The Bangkok Post quoted a police spokesman as confirming that the authorities could not proceed with any legal action against the ambassador. But Thailand can rescind his diplomatic credentials.
The ambassador had only arrived in Thailand in October to take up the post.
A spokesman for the US embassy in Bangkok told the BBC that it was preparing a response on the matter.
Prosecutions under the law have soared since the military coup in 2014, with about 100 people charged. Critics say the law has been used suppress dissent.

In it, he contrasted the military government's tolerance of protests outside the US embassy against Glyn Davies by ultra-royalists with the detention of dozens of activists heading to protest at a military-built park glorifying Thailand's monarchy, which has been tainted by a corruption scandal.

""I will never forget that moment,"" Gualtieri told BBC Sport. ""I had dreamt about it but I never thought it would happen. It was so hard for us to score against anybody, let alone a team as big as England.""
""The stage is set for England's last and decisive match in this World Cup qualifying group. England in red, San Marino in blue, England needing to win by a seven-goal margin and hope that Poland can do them a favour in Poznan against Holland. [Whistle sounds to start game.] I'm sure you're aware now what's at stake. And Nicola Bacciocchi the number nine picks the ball up straight away and San Marino launch the first attack, oh and a mistake by Stuart Pearce and San Marino have scored. I don't believe this.""
When I spoke to him this week, Taylor could not remember the name of the player who inflicted on him the final ignominy of his time as national manager, but he did not need reminding that the goal remains the fastest scored in a World Cup match - qualifiers or finals.
With  for the first meeting between the two nations since, I felt slightly guilty asking Taylor to relive some of the agony it involved - although it clearly hurt him a lot more at the time.
Taylor told me: ""When the ball went into the net, I looked up towards the sky and just said quietly to myself 'god, please tell me what I have done wrong'.
""I can laugh about it now because that is a true story. Normally I would accept responsibility for every result, and every goal but, I mean, we were eight seconds into the game. I knew we would go on and win but you think to yourself 'what the hell is happening here?'
""His name hasn't stuck in my memory but I can picture the goal as I'm talking to you now. I can see Stuart and David Seaman and the San Marino player slipping in and putting it into the net. I can see it happening, but I still can't stop it!
""Good luck to the guy, though. I wish him well.""
England went on to win 7-1 in what was Taylor's last game in charge, with Ian Wright scoring four goals. But it was a hollow victory.
To reach USA '94, England had been left needing to win their final game of a calamitous campaign by seven goals and hope Poland beat the Netherlands. The score at half-time in Poznan was 1-1 but Dennis Bergkamp put the Dutch ahead before the hour mark and Ronald de Boer's late goal extinguished all hope.
Back in Bologna's Stadio Renato Dall'Ara, where San Marino played their home games, England were by now well on their way to a one-sided victory but the mood was bleak.
""Nearly everyone in the ground was following what was going on in Holland's match,"" Taylor added. ""In fact, it was difficult to stop people telling you what was happening.
""So there wasn't any enjoyment to be had from our game. We had beaten San Marino 6-0 at Wembley so we put 13 goals past them in total but we had still only done what people expected and, of course, we knew the Dutch had won too so we were out no matter how many we scored.
""It was a very hard trip and one of the worst aspects of it was that we flew back to Luton Airport and had to fight our way through the press and photographers.
""We had no security and no-one to meet us and we had to get our luggage and fight our way to our cars on our own. You wouldn't have that now - it's a completely different world.
""I was pushing against the photographers who were deliberately getting in the way of the trolley in the hope I would stop, but I kept pushing. I think I caught a few shins that day but, to tell you the truth, I was quite happy to because cameras were being shoved pretty much into my face.""
Taylor resigned six days later. Things were turning out rather more happily for Gualtieri, meanwhile, who got Pearce's shirt as a souvenir at the final whistle but did not speak to any of the England players because ""they were all a bit angry"".
Gualtieri did not find out his goal was a world record until journalists told him after the game, and he did not realise he had made the front page of several British newspapers until he was sent a copy of the Daily Mirror, with the headline ""End of the world"" and his picture on it.
England team: David Seaman; Lee Dixon, Gary Pallister, Des Walker, Stuart Pearce; Stuart Ripley, Paul Ince, David Platt, Andy Sinton; Ian Wright, Les Ferdinand.

He has had plenty of attention since then, too, including more than 270,000 views of his goal on YouTube. Gualtieri, who also owns a video of the game, last watched it about six months ago but he is expecting it to get plenty more viewings this week.
Now 41 and a computer salesman in San Marino with a lot less hair than he had in 1993, he does not speak any English but, with his wife Caterina translating, I asked him how he became aware of what turned out to be an enduring fame - and a particular popularity with Scotland supporters.
Tales that Scottish fans paid for his drinks on a night out when they came over for a European Championship qualifier against San Marino a couple of years later turned out to be an invention, but Gualtieri's brother did benefit from some Caledonian hospitality.
""Over here, nobody really knew what was going on but in England there was a big fuss,"" Gualtieri explained.
""Even now, some fans from around the world are always coming into my shop with pictures of me and shirts for me to sign.
""And, when my brother went to Scotland on holiday, they found out who he was and bought him drinks and a meal too. But that was my brother, not me.""
When I ask him which player he used to compare himself to, Gualtieri describes himself with a laugh as ""a poor man's Roberto Baggio"". But, despite only ever being a part-time player, he is a full-time member of footballing folklore, and will stay that way even if his record is eventually broken.",It is almost 19 years since Davide Gualtieri scored the goal that still has people asking him for his autograph - and left Graham Taylor wondering whether his time as England manager really was cursed.,19900296

131,"Forest spurned a great chance to lead when Ross McCormack's penalty was saved by goalkeeper Keiren Westwood.
Home fans were furious Westwood was not sent off for fouling Ben Brereton and the anger was compounded as the Owls took control through Almen Abdi's 25-yarder and Fernando Forestieri's shot.
Ben Osborn's shot gave hope but Forest could not avoid a third straight loss.
Wednesday's win sees them go level on points with Yorkshire rivals Leeds United and takes them seven points clear in the final play-off spot following Norwich City's defeat at Burton.
But Forest were with a strong sense of injustice after seeing their 100% home record come to an end under interim boss Gary Brazil.
A bright home start looked like being rewarded when the impressive Brereton ran on to McCormack's pass.
However, Westwood's foul was only deemed worthy of a yellow card and within two minutes Abdi's stunning long-range effort put the Owls ahead.
Forest, who slip to 18th, enjoyed some decent spells of possession after falling further behind early in the second half.
But although more good work by teenage striker Brereton teed up Osborn to bring hope, they could not fashion a telling opening in a cagey final 30 minutes.
Nottingham Forest interim boss Gary Brazil:
""The rules say that he [Westwood] should not be sent off now, so there is no point in moaning about it.
""But it is critical moments in games that decide whether you take three points, so it was tough for us. Not only to see us not score from the penalty - and we are not being critical of Ross, because he did not fail to score on purpose - but then to see them go down the other end of the pitch and score with a shot right into the 'postage stamp'.
""When that happens you can't help but feel a sense of injustice, just because of the timing of it all. And seeing the opposition score with another great finish like that is getting a bit repetitive, isn't it?
""I thought the second goal was soft however, because Forestieri had his back to goal and seeing him get the ball in the net from there was very disappointing.
""We should have guided him away from goal. We did manage to get a goal back and Ben Brereton was a threat throughout - we just could not find an equaliser.""
Sheffield Wednesday manager Carlos Carvalhal: ""It was a difficult game, but we deserved the win.
""There were big moments in the game that were very important. One was when they missed the penalty and the other was when we scored a few minutes later.
""Even when Forest scored a goal, it was a mistake from us. We did not allow Forest to create too many chances, we were calm and the keeper did not have too many saves to make.
""I have said in the past that a good goalkeeper is not one who has to make 20 saves in a game - because our opponents do not create many chances against us.
""A good goalkeeper is one who makes saves when he has to; when the team needs him to. Kieren is a fantastic goalkeeper and when the team needs him, he is there.""

132,"In 2013, 284 out of every 100,000 people died from cancer. In 2003, it was 312. Improvements in diagnosis and treatment are thought to be the reason.
The death rate for men fell 12% and for women by 8%, narrowing the gender gap.
But the actual number of cancer deaths rose - from 155,000 in 2003 to 162,000 in 2013 - as more people live longer and develop the disease in old age.
""The population is growing, and more of us are living longer,"" Cancer Research UK chief executive Sir Harpal Kumar said.
Almost half of all the cancer deaths in 2013 were from lung, bowel, breast or prostate cancer.
Although the combined death rate for these four cancers had dropped by about 11% over the past 10 years, some other cancers, such as liver and pancreatic, had increased death rates.
Sir Harpal said: ""Too many people are still being diagnosed with and dying from cancer, not just here in the UK but around the world.""
He said CRUK was focusing research on how to achieve earlier diagnosis and manage hard-to-treat cancers.
""Our scientists are developing new tests, surgical and radiotherapy techniques, and drugs,"" he said.
""It's important to celebrate how much things have improved, but also to renew our commitment to saving the lives of more cancer patients.""

133,"CalMac said it expected all its routes to run on Saturday, although there have been some changes to timetables.
The strike by RMT union members followed a two-day work to rule.
The dispute centres on concerns that Clyde and Hebrides ferry routes could be taken over by private firm Serco.
CalMac managed to operate about nine of its 27 routes on Saturday despite the strike by RMT members, who make up half of the company's workforce.
Further talks aimed at ending the dispute, which was triggered by the Scottish government's tendering process for the contract to run the Clyde and Hebrides ferry network, are due to be held in London next week.
CalMac is facing a challenge from Serco to renew the contract.
Serco already runs the Northlink ferries to Orkney and Shetland and the Caledonian Sleeper overnight rail service from Scotland to London.
Scottish ministers have said they are forbidden by EU competition regulations from favouring one bid over another, and that breaking the law would open them up to an expensive legal challenge and potential fines.
But union leaders have said that if Serco won the contract it would mean the privatisation of Clyde and Hebrides ferry services.
The RMT has asked that the government guarantees in the new contract that compulsory redundancies do not happen and existing terms and conditions are continued regardless of who wins the contract.
The Scottish government has called on both sides to show ""common sense"" by finding a solution to the dispute in order to prevent further disruption to island communities.",Ferry services on the west coast of Scotland are returning to normal after a 24-hour strike by Caledonian MacBrayne staff on Friday caused two thirds of its services to be cancelled.,33295813

A picture with Beckham was flavour of the month for much of the 1990s - and beyond. And Sam Daniels' parents were so keen they took him down to what looks like United's old training ground in Salford to meet a pair of famous number sevens.

The rotation of the statue, which always faced the sun, was stopped several weeks ago.
On Wednesday it was removed and workers are now tackling the huge tripod base.
The 15m (50ft) statue and its 75m marble-covered plinth - called the Arch of Neutrality - were seen as representative of the excesses of Mr Niyazov.
The self-styled ""Turkmenbashi"" - meaning the father of all Turkmen - established a comprehensive personality cult.
Streets, cities and months were named after him and his family, and portraits of him hung across the country.

139,"The UK Foreign Office said the Russian planes, which came near UK airspace on Wednesday before being ""escorted"" by RAF jets, were ""part of an increasing pattern of out-of-area operations"".
Russia's ambassador to the UK said the concerns were ""not understandable"".
He insisted the patrols were ""routine"" and met ""international legal norms"".
Typhoon fighters were scrambled from RAF Lossiemouth and RAF Coningsby to escort the Russian aircraft, and the RAF said the mission lasted 12 hours.
The Foreign Office refused to give details of the disruption to civil aviation.
BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale said the Russian planes - two Tu-95 Bear H bombers - came within 25 miles of the UK.
They travelled from the north, past the west coast of Ireland and to the English Channel before turning and going back the way they had come, he said.
He said the bombers did not file a flight plan, did not have their transponders switched on and ""weren't talking to air traffic control"".
In a statement, the Russian embassy in the UK said ambassador Alexander Yakovenko had met with British officials to discuss the issue.
The statement said: ""This flight (as all other routine flights of the Russian military aircraft) was carried out in strict compliance with the international legal norms including international flight rules and regulations, without violation of other countries' airspace, therefore it cannot be regarded as threatening, destabilising or disruptive.""
In response to a recent parliamentary question, the Ministry of Defence disclosed the number of days when Quick Reaction Alert flights were launched against Russian military aircraft
This is the latest in a series of similar incidents involving Russian aircraft. Last month Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said the UK was concerned about the ""extremely aggressive probing"" of its airspace by Russia.
In a statement on the RAF website, one of the controllers involved in the mission said: ""Thanks to our integration with air defence systems across Nato, we were able to begin mission planning early and therefore were ready to act in good time.""
The controller added: ""The operations room was both calm and focused.
""We constantly train for these scenarios so that we are well rehearsed and ready to maintain the integrity of our airspace.""
Former RAF pilot Andrew Brookes, who is a fellow at defence think tank The Royal United Services Institute, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme similar incidents had happened in other parts of the world.
He added: ""The Russians are coming back on to the world stage, they've cranked up an air force that they have neglected for many years, and they are basically strutting their stuff around the globe.""
Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said there had been a sharp increase in the number of times Russian planes were intercepted by members.
He said: ""Last year, allied aircraft intercepted Russian planes over 400 times. Over 150 of these intercepts were conducted by Nato's Baltic air policing mission. That's about four times as many as in 2013.

140,"Northampton Saint North will be 23 years and 138 days when he runs out at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin.
He has scored 22 tries and played three Lions Tests, but Gatland wants more from his giant wing.
""I think he's got the ability to be a lot better than he is,"" he said.
""He's had 50 caps which is fantastic but I think there's still a lot of improvement.
""And probably in the last 12 months he hasn't played as well as we would have liked, he's aware of that and we've been working hard on his game.""
North will be playing for the first time in five months following an enforced lay-off to recover from concussion.
He scored a hat-trick of tries on his last appearance for Wales against Italy in the 2015 Six Nations, and scored two for the British and Irish Lions during the 2013 Test series against Australia.
However, Gatland believes North's recent international form has not been up to the standards he believes the player is capable of because of a tendency to become peripheral to the action.
""Players of that ability need to get their hands on the ball,"" he added.
""He probably went through a couple of campaigns where his touches weren't enough, and he made some defensive errors so it was pleasing to see some of that confidence has come back into his game [against Italy].""
However, Gatland, who first capped North as an 18-year-old against South Africa in 2010, said North's achievements were ""fantastic"".
""What he has achieved in the game at such a young age is exceptional,"" he said.
""I remember seeing him as an 18-year-old playing for the Scarlets and saying 'look we have to cap him as soon as possible because there's a freakish talent there'.

But England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) bosses have told county members' forums this week that 2020 is now their targeted start date.
That is partly because the existing broadcasting deal expires in 2019.
The ECB is keen to introduce a new T20 event to rival the Indian Premier League and Australia's Big Bash League, and has said this is a watershed moment for the sport in England and Wales.
It has said it needs to draw new audiences to the game and believes a new competition would increase revenues for all.
The eight-team proposal, which was one of five on the table, was passed by a majority vote at Lord's in September.
It followed discussions between representatives of the 18 first-class counties, the Professional Cricketers' Association, and the MCC, which is the guardian of the laws and spirit of cricket.
Surrey, Kent and Sussex were reportedly against the move.
A fear games would only be held at Test match venues was said to be behind some of the initial opposition.
But the ECB, which is discussing the plans for the competition at a board meeting on Tuesday, is referring to the new tournament as regional rather than city-based or franchise-based.
That could open the way for some games to be held at non-Test grounds.
Some counties have welcomed the proposal, but the BBC understands others have raised concerns about its potential impact on their revenue and future health.
Several counties have also expressed misgivings about a lack of detail behind the idea, which is still in the planning stage.
Championship toss rule unchanged
The ECB has also decided to extend the 'optional toss' regulation, introduced this summer, for the 2017 season.
It means visiting captains can choose to bowl first without the need for a toss.
If, however, they decide not to exercise that right, a toss will take place in the usual way.
The measure was introduced to prevent home counties preparing seamer-friendly pitches, and to encourage more spin bowling.

""Each day that passes without the policy in place restricts the armed forces' ability to recruit the best and the brightest, regardless of gender identity,"" said Human Rights Campaign spokesman Stephen Peters in a statement.
Mr Mattis said in a memo quoted by the Washington Post he had decided more time was needed to make a decision after consulting senior defence officials, adding that the delay ""in no way presupposes an outcome"".

147,"It comes after a recent study revealed a link between the drug and developmental problems in children.
The Welsh government said it was not its remit and a UK government agency said it followed national guidelines.
Meanwhile, Newport West MP Paul Flynn told The Wales Report on BBC Wales that the mothers' plight was ""dreadful"".
Doctors have been aware of the risk associated with the anticonvulsant drug sodium valproate, known as Epilim, for decades.
But a recent study by the University of Liverpool also revealed a link between the drug and other developmental problems in children.
Joanne Cozens, from Caerphilly, is one of the 32,000 people in Wales with epilepsy.
She started taking Epilim as a teenager and continued during her pregnancy.
Mrs Cozens' 13-year-old son Tomas has Asperger's syndrome. She claims she was not warned of the danger to her unborn and says she would never have taken Epilim had she been told.
She said: ""If somebody had read all those abnormalities out when I went to see a specialist … there's no chance I would ever have taken those tablets.
""As a mother you do anything in your power for your child and I was completely torn apart, devastated, to think that something I'd put in my mouth had caused Tom to suffer in the way he's  suffered over the years.""
The drug has been around since the mid-seventies and can cause heart problems and a range of physical deformities, such as spina bifida and cleft lip in unborn babies.
The latest research by the university suggests unborn babies exposed to the drug could also be born with mental disorders, a low IQ and autism.
Campaigner Nicole Crosby-McKenna, from Epilepsy Action, wants the Welsh government to review the way information is conveyed to pregnant patients in Wales.
She said: ""We would like to know, if they haven't got access to an epilepsy specialist nurse, who is giving the women that information? Are the GPs passing the information on to women? And also, do the GPs have enough specialist knowledge to accurately give them pre-conception counselling?""
Newport West MP Paul Flynn said: ""The plight of these mothers is a dreadful one because they tend to blame themselves but whatever it is, it's nothing to do with the mother.
""They took the advice of the doctors and the failure was the medical system and the drug companies that failed to live up to their responsibility.""
Dr Khalid Hamandi, from the Welsh Epilepsy Unit at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, said: ""We feel that services are under-provided for.
""We need more neurologists, more specialists with an interest in epilepsy, and we need more awareness and involvement in epilepsy in primary care.""
But the Welsh government said it was the responsibility of the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).
A government spokesman said: ""Medicines licensing, ie ensuring quality, safety and efficacy is not devolved, it is the remit of MHRA.""
A spokesman for the MHRA said it followed national guidelines.
He said: ""Product information clearly states that Epilim should not be prescribed to women of child-bearing potential unless clearly necessary; in such cases effective contraception must be used during treatment. The product information for Epilim also contains clear advice about its safety of use during pregnancy, including information about the potential for risk of developmental delay, particularly of verbal IQ and the risk of autism spectrum disorders.""
This is supported by research carried out by the University of Liverpool.
Professor Gus Baker, a neuropsychologist, followed 600 babies from birth to aged six and found a marked difference in the brain development of some of the children.

148,"The 60kg calf named Bonnie was born at the park, near Stirling, following a 16-month pregnancy.
Keepers said the birth marked an important step in the work to save the species from extinction.
Southern white rhinos, native to the south of Africa, are currently listed as near-threatened on the IUCN red list of endangered species.
The calf is the fifth to be born at the park to mother Dot and father Graham, both aged 16.
Animal collection manager Sheila Walker said: ""The birth was very straightforward and the calf was up on its feet and suckling in just over an hour.
""Dot is a great mum and very experienced, having successfully raised four calves previously. She was even giving gentle nudges, encouraging the calf to its feet - but it managed all by itself, albeit a bit wobbly at first.""
Despite its endangered listing, the white rhino has fared far better than its northern counterpart, which was declared extinct in the wild in 2008. About 18,000 southern white rhinos remain in the wild.
The animal's decline has been blamed on poaching in Africa. Blair Drummond said it was committed to doing its bit to help save the species from extinction.
Ailsa McCormick, head keeper of the park's large mammals, said: ""The calf is of big importance to the endangered species breeding programme, and I'm delighted to oversee Dot and Graham's continued part in ensuring a strong viable insurance population for southern white rhinos.
""This calf is their fifth, and being grandparents at 16 years old, Dot and Graham's latest calf is a big feather in the cap for the ongoing conservation efforts made by Blair Drummond.""

150,"Following Wednesday's killing of 13 people including ex-MP Waja Karim Dad, violence escalated and officials say more bodies were recovered overnight.
Police say many of those killed were kidnapped first and that some victims appear to have been tortured.
The attacks unfolded as Karachi's main MQM political party announced it will rejoin Pakistan's coalition government.
The party had left the PPP-led coalition after accusing its majority partner of not doing enough to stop the violence.
Police say that 315 people were killed in such attacks in Karachi in July 2011.
The BBC's Syed Shoaib Hasan in Karachi says that the bodies are appearing all over the city stuffed in jute bags.
Our correspondent says that while initially politically motivated, the killings are now increasingly indiscriminate. Women, children and teenage footballers are amongst those gunned down.
Police say that the bodies bear the marks of extreme torture: some have even had their eyes gouged out. They said that it appears as if almost all the victims were kidnapped before being tortured only to be shot dead and deposited on the city streets.
Police surgeon Hamid Parihar told the BBC that he ""had been collecting bodies since midnight and they are still coming in"".
Analysts say that the latest spate of violence appears to have taken place between criminal gangs in the city's deprived Lyari neighbourhood. The area has a reputation of armed gangs dealing in drugs and extortion rackets.
This is where former parliamentarian Waja Karim Dad was gunned down.
Our correspondent reports that a sense of fear prevails throughout the city and that public transport has been suspended.
Killings in Karachi have continued despite efforts to reconcile its warring political factions.

151,"Health Minister Michelle O'Neill said the 10-year plan would improve a system at ""breaking point"".
Its 18 time-specific action points are based on recommendations from a government-appointed panel.
Hospital closures are not mentioned, but services will have to meet criteria to prove they are viable, she said.
Opposition politicians have questioned the lack of details in the plan, which is not costed.
Northern Ireland's health system had not changed quickly enough to meet the needs of an ageing population, and was unsustainable, Ms O'Neill told MLAs.
""If we continue as we are now, the system in 10 years would need 90% of the entire executive budget.""
Not one but indeed two reports have made a compelling case for changing how health and social care services are delivered in Northern Ireland.
In stark language, the health minister said the system is at breaking point and that it is not sustainable.
It may be a 10-year vision but short-term fixes in the past have failed.

Her plan sets out a range of priorities, including a focus on keeping people healthy in the first place, and a new model of care involving a team of professionals based around GP surgeries.

On Tuesday evening, the health minister said she was prepared to use the independent sector as a short term measure to tackle hospital waiting lists.
The minister said her plan did not offer ""a quick fix"".
""This change will be planned, managed, incremental - this is not a ""Big Bang,"" she said.
Meaningful change would require time, money and the support of government, staff and those who use our health and social care services, she added.
This is a report with recommendations. But they are broad in their ideas and their ambitions.
And certainly, at this stage, many are lacking in detail and questions remain on how they will be funded.

First Minister Arlene Foster said the plan represented a challenge the Executive was going to meet head on.
Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness added that change was required, and ""the only question is whether it will happen in a controlled, planned fashion or unfold out of control"".
But opposition MLAs criticised the proposals, with Ulster Unionist health spokesperson Jo-Anne Dobson questioning their lack of detail.
The SDLP's Mark H Durkan said a ""spectre of doubt"" hung over the plans, while TUV leader Jim Allister said they were merely ""recycling of a great plethora of fine words"".
A review into Northern Ireland's health service was commissioned in January by Stormont ministers seeking advice on how to improve services, cut waiting lists and care for an aging population.
Professor Rafael Bengoa, chair of the expert panel behind the review, said Northern Ireland faced ""a stark choice"".
""It can either resist change and see services deteriorate to the point of collapse over time, or embrace transformation and work to create a modern sustainable service,"" he said.

152,"It is the final race of the world championship - estimated to be worth Â£10m to the Welsh economy.
The official ""shakedown"" test drives got under way on Thursday morning before the ceremonial start at Llandudno, Conwy county.
The father of Colin McRae, the former champion killed in a helicopter crash in 2007, will drop the starting flag.
Former co-driver, Welshman Nicky Grist, will also be at the rally for the weekend as the event marks the contribution McRae made to rallying across the world - becoming the youngest ever driver to lift the world title in 1995.
Racing proper begins on Friday morning in the Hafren forest stage near Llanidloes, Powys.
The race ends on Sunday, with stages taking in the Denbigh Moors, Llandudno's Great Orme and a ceremonial finish at the Deeside service park in Flintshire.

153,"What do you get if you cross a dance show with a gig by The Smiths?
The answer might look something like If You Kiss Me, Kiss Me - a new kind of theatrical experience about to open at London's Young Vic.
Accompanied by a live band and a company of dancers,  Ab Fab star Jane Horrocks will belt out a selection of mainly new wave songs she grew up with in Lancashire in the late 70s and  early 80s.
""It's music from my past - most of the songs are from northern, male bands in the late 1970s and early 80s,"" Horrocks explains. ""Some of them are very loyal, but most are reinvented. They've got a bit more of a contemporary edge to them.""
Horrocks chose the songs along with her partner, screenwriter Nick Vivian, who she describes as ""a human Spotify"".
The set list - which mixes singles with lesser-known album tracks - features Joy Division's Atrocity Exhibition and Isolation, Buzzcocks' Fiction Romance and What Do I Get? and The Human League's Empire State Human.
Other songs include Soft Cell's Memorabilia, The Smiths' I Know It's Over, New Order's Temptation and Morrissey's Life Is a Pigsty.
Horrocks admits that the first record she bought was from a very different genre.
""I think it was David Essex. My mum and dad's music tastes influenced me massively - like Shirley Bassey and big-band stuff like Count Basie. My brother was a massive influence too - he had contemporary tastes like David Bowie and Marc Bolan and then punk and post-punk stuff. I had those musical genres running in conjunction.""
Horrocks says she was always attracted to ""torch song singers"" like Ian Curtis, Morrissey and Marc Almond.
""Ian Curtis's and Morrissey's lyrics are amazing - they are proper poets. A lot of Ian Curtis's lyrics you can't actually hear, so I thought it would be nice to hear them clearly, as you can in our version of Isolation.""
The concept for the show sprang from Horrocks's wish to combine a narrative with songs in a way that didn't make it a traditional musical. She took the idea to the Young Vic's artistic director David Lan, who was keen to develop it.
The result, described by Lan as ""part dance piece, part gig"", is directed and choreographed by Aletta Collins. The on-stage band features Rat Scabies from punk icons The Damned on drums.
""It's a love story that starts out a bit cynical but has a happier ending,"" says Horrocks. ""There's a little bit of dialogue.""
Given that the songs take centre stage, why put it in a theatre and not a gig venue?
""I wanted it to be a theatrical experience with a proper set,"" says Horrocks. ""Bunny Christie's design is very rock'n'roll but it's very theatrical as well.
""The team are all theatre-based but they are thinking in a gig mode. Everybody is being taken out of their comfort zone. It's turning theatre on its head and mixing it up.""
Horrocks, who won acclaim for her ability to mimic the likes of Edith Piaf, Judy Garland and Shirley Bassey in the stage and screen versions of Little Voice, is no stranger to the Young Vic. She performed there in Annie Get Your Gun in 2009 and The Good Soul of Szechuan in 2008.
She's best known on TV for her role as Bubble, the ditzy media PA in sitcom Absolutely Fabulous.
Our interview takes place a day after the actress has added a new talent to her CV - that of fashion model.
She'd appeared on the catwalk at London Fashion Week as part of a showcase by designers Vin + Omi, who created the wacky costumes for Bubble in the forthcoming film Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie.
""Working with Vin + Omi and costume designer Rebecca Hale was the best part for me,"" says Horrocks of her big-screen reunion with the Ab Fab gang.
Newspaper photos taken during filming in January showed Horrocks wearing an outlandish outfit festooned with inflatable hashtag slogans.
""We wanted to make Bubble as here and now as possible and they were the perfect designers to do that,"" Horrocks explains. ""This is the first time in all my years of Ab Fab that I've actually focused on the fashion side.""
Meanwhile, Horrocks says rehearsals for If You Kiss Me, Kiss Me have ""a really nice vibe"" although she admits she's finding the dance routines a challenge.
""I think the other dancers think I'm like a lump of lead when I have to be choreographed, but when I'm allowed to go freestyle I'm OK.
""It's going to be a visual feast.""

154,"Estate agency Knight Frank estimated that 5.79 million households would rent from a private landlord by 2021, up from five million now.
That increase would include pensioners, as well as young adults, it suggested.
While many are saving for a deposit on a house, a third of the 10,000 tenants asked said they rented through choice.
Of these, the flexibility of renting and the reduced responsibility were popular. A fifth said they chose to be tenants as it allowed them to live in an area where owning a home was unaffordable.
""The number of people renting out of choice rather than due to affordability of ownership constraints is an interesting indicator of how the private rented sector market will continue to thrive in terms of tenant demand,"" said Tim Hyatt, head of residential lettings at Knight Frank.
The estate agency expects big investors to move further into the rental property sector, replacing some buy-to-let landlords who have been hit by recent tax rises.
The average cost of a house or flat in the UK is now Â£220,706, according to the latest property price survey from the Halifax.
The Knight Frank research found that across the rental sector the biggest group of tenants was those seeking to save up to buy their own property.
The affordability of rent was the biggest consideration, for them and other tenants. Location was the next biggest factor - a much larger concern than the size of the property itself.
Across the UK, more than half of commuters live within a 30-minute journey from work, while in London, this falls to 31%.
The estate agency forecast slightly faster growth in the number of households made up of under-25s who rent, but that there would also be a rise among the baby-boomer generation as well.
This echoes a separate survey published on Monday by lettings network Countrywide which suggested that retired people now accounted for 8% of tenants, compared with 5.2% in 2007.
It said that the average retiree paid Â£810 a month in rent, about 12% lower than the typical tenant, with people in the older age group tending to live in smaller properties,","Two-thirds of UK tenants still expect to be living in the rented sector in three years' time, with affordability their biggest concern, a survey says.",40248004
155,"Marilyn Shankle-Grant's son, Paul Storey, has been fighting his death sentence for almost 10 years. All his legal efforts so far have fallen short, and in autumn, a judge set his execution date for 12 April, 2017.
Storey was convicted in the 2006 shooting death of 28-year-old Jonas Cherry during an armed robbery. Storey's accomplice - the gunman - pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life in prison. Storey went forward with a jury trial and received the death penalty in 2008.
Since he was sent to death row, Shankle-Grant has been able to see her son about once a month, making the four-hour drive from her home in Fort Worth, Texas, to the state prison in Livingston, Texas.
But recently things have got more difficult for the 57-year-old hospitality worker. The stress and depression over her son's impending execution was affecting her work performance, and she lost a job she had held for 30 years.
She tried to pick up temporary work, and even started her own business, Marilyn's Old-Fashioned Tea Cakes, baking flat, buttery rounds from her grandmother's recipe, wrapping them up in cellophane and selling them at local events.
But even that small income stream has dried up - she stopped making tea cakes not long after her son's execution date was announced.
""When I do them, I do it with lots of love,"" she explains. ""Right now that's just not in me.""
The situation has become dire - her Forth Worth home entered foreclosure this week. She needs $8,000 (about Â£6,400) to save it.
Her financial difficulty - not to mention her broken car - have made the trips to Livingston a real financial strain, at the same time that the approaching execution date makes them more important than ever. She estimates each trip costs roughly $350.
With just six weeks left to visit before her son is executed, Shankle-Grant posted a weary status to her Facebook page, lamenting the short amount of time she has left with her son and the financial struggle she faces just to see him.
It caught the eye of Abraham J Bonowitz, co-director of Death Penalty Action, an anti-death penalty charity. He had met Shankle-Grant many times over the years at death penalty abolition events.
Bonowitz reached out to Shankle-Grant to ask her permission to set up an online fundraiser on her behalf. He created a page on the crowdfunding site You Caring, which included a note from Shankle-Grant.
""My love and devotion to my son are not matched by the resources needed to make the trip as often as I am allowed to visit him,"" she wrote. ""With a heavy heart I turn to my fellow human light to ask you to help me help my son face the darkness as his destruction approaches.""
The donations began streaming in. One anonymous donor contributed $1,000.
""My father was executed in Texas 13 years ago, and while the situation is still painful, I'm thankful for our last few visits, and I know he was as well,"" wrote one contributor.
""Nobody's going to be able to take away the pain that Marilyn has, but we can take away some of the anxiety,"" says Bonowitz, who is considering making these fundraisers a permanent part of his work.
So far, he has raised nearly $6,000. The money allows Shankle-Grant to rent a car each weekend, stay for two nights in a nearby hotel, as well as pay for meals and gas.
Thanks to the funds, Shankle-Grant has been able to visit her son every weekend since. She says she is incredibly grateful for the help.
""None of this would be able to be happening if it weren't for that You Caring page,"" she says. ""I'm able to talk to him. When he's down and out and depressed, we can talk about it and talk him through it. It gives me comfort, too.""
Shankle-Grant's situation illustrates the hidden impact on the families of the condemned, who often come from low-income backgrounds and can live far away from the prison in which their loved one is housed. After 30 years of death penalty abolition work, Bonowitz has seen the situation many times before. Often a church or a non-profit will step in to help defray the cost of visiting a family member before an execution.
""None of these families have any money,"" he says. ""Marilyn never did anything wrong and yet she is made to suffer. It's her son's fault, yes, but that doesn't mean the love for her child stops.""
The success of the fundraiser caught the attention of advocates in Arkansas, which is poised to execute eight inmates over the course of 10 days, due to the fact that the state's supply of an execution drug called midazolam is about to expire.
Deborah Robinson, a freelance journalist who is writing a book about the eight men, says she has heard from three of them, asking for help so that their families can see them before the execution dates in late April.
""I have a 21-year-old daughter whom I haven't seen in 17 years, along with a 3-year-old granddaughter,"" wrote inmate Kenneth Williams, who is scheduled to die on 27 April, in a message to Robinson.
""The financial costs have prevented her from coming. If I am going to be executed, I would love to see her before I go one last time and to see my grandchild for the first time.""
Lynn Scott, the sister of death row inmate Jack Jones, Jr, lives in North Carolina. She runs her own business as a wedding planner, but she and her husband lost nearly everything after the 2008 recession - their house, their 401k, they sold off most of their possessions. After Scott's husband suffered a massive heart attack in 2015, they found themselves financially devastated.
""We live paycheck to paycheck,"" she says.
Arkansas is scheduled to execute her brother on 24 April. With airfare, hotel, car rental and meals - plus cremation and burial expenses - she expects that she will need about $5,000.
""It's very difficult,"" says Scott. ""What I want people to know is - whatever the inmates did, we didn't do that. I didn't do that to those people, but I'm still losing someone.""
Modelling a crowdfunding page after the one in Texas, Robinson is now raising funds for all three Arkansas families to help defray some of those costs.
If Shankle-Grant's You Caring page raises more money than she can use to see her son, she says she wants the excess funds to go to the families in Arkansas.
Her son, Storey, still has a lawyer fighting for a stay of execution, in part based on the fact that his victim's parents are opposed to the death penalty and do not want him to be executed. Glenn and Judy Cherry have written letters to Texas Governor Greg Abbott and other state officials asking for mercy.
Shankle-Grant still holds out hope that her son's execution will be halted, and the portion of the fundraiser money that is designated for her son's burial can be sent to the other families. She is asking supporters to write letters to the Texas Department of Corrections, asking that Storey's life be spared.
In the meantime, because of a court hearing Storey has been moved to a county jail that allows him to use the phone for the first time in years (phone calls are not allowed for death row inmates in his prison). Shankle-Grant says he has been able to talk to his elderly grandparents, who can't travel to see him, and thanks to the fundraiser, she was easily able to pay the hefty $300 phone bill. She is also able to talk to him, sometimes as often as four times a day.
It's a small comfort as the execution date creeps closer and closer.
""He'll hang up and call back, hang up and call back,"" she says. ""I don't know after [nine] days if I'm ever going to hear his voice again. For me, it's very important.""","For the families of men facing the death penalty, money can be a barrier to seeing a loved one before the end.",39460976
156,"The mammals have been creating a stir off Baltimore in west Cork in the Irish Republic for the last two weeks as they feed on shoals of sprat and herring.
There are five animals in the humpback group and they have been getting a lot of attention, with reports in Ireland's national newspapers and segments on the state broadcaster RTE.
The  Irish Whale and Dolphin Group have been monitoring the group and believe that four of them have visited the same waters off west Cork in the past, some as recently as 2008.
""It is known from the western Atlantic that humpback whales form stable social associations with other whales on the feeding grounds, so this is not just a coincidence,"" the IWDG website said.
People have been getting up close to the denizens of the deep, which were once hunted to the brink of extinction, on boat trips from local harbours.
Simon Duggan is a local photographer and went out with friends to see what they could capture.
As can be seen from his picture he was luckier than the group on another boat, who appear to all be looking the wrong way.
""Bad weather had stopped us going out, but there was a break on Saturday so we went out,"" he said.
""We'd been out for a few hours and had been watching them when this one started to breach.
""It's a pretty amazing sight, there are minke whales, fin whales and lots of dolphins and harbour porpoise, but the humpbacks are rarer.""
Mr Duggan got the shot because he was in the right place at the right time. He and fellow photographer Youen Jacob were looking for the whales and on this occasion Mr Jacob was steering the boat.
Both men are volunteers with the RNLI in at Baltimore Lifeboat Station and get to spend a fair amount of time at sea.
He said the animal breached about six times, so the watchers on the other boat may have been able to catch the repeat performance.
Mr Duggan said that whale watching is a popular activity in the area in the winter months.
""There really isn't a lot to do in Baltimore during November and December so it's become a bit of a hobby for me and some friends and occasionally you get to see this sort of thing.""
They were photgraphed bubble feeding by Mr Jacob last week, a technique which sees the whales going under a school of fish and releasing bubbles to confuse the fish and bunch them together.
Then the whales surge upwards through the school with mouths wide open so they can scoop as many fish as possible.
The IWDG said the scenes of the animals bubble feeding were remarkable, but that while the viewing off Cork was spectacular it was not without precedent.
On its website the group said that there was going to be increased demand on whale watching boats because of the increase in activity, but that it was taking place so near to shore that a pair of binoculars would be enough to enjoy the show.","It could almost be saying ""I'm behind you"", but humpback whales aren't known for pranking boatloads of whale watchers.",20580373

The 33-year-old American won 6-4 6-4 on Centre Court to claim her 21st Grand Slam title and third of 2015.
Williams withstood a late fightback from 20th seed Muguruza, 21, to come through in one hour and 23 minutes.
She will head to the US Open next month aiming to complete the first calendar year Grand Slam of her career.
Muguruza was playing in her first Grand Slam final and took a 4-2 lead, before giving the top seed a mighty scare by battling back from a set and 5-1 down with two breaks of serve.
She could not quite complete the comeback, however, with an error-strewn service game setting up Williams to clinch a landmark win when the Spaniard found the tramlines.
""There was definitely pressure towards the end,"" said Williams, who also completed the 'Serena Slam' in 2003.
""Garbine started playing really well and I just had to think to stay out there and work really hard.
""I am having so much fun out on the court. Everyday is a pleasure to be playing and winning Wimbledon.""
A victory in New York would see the world number one match Steffi Graf's calendar Slam of 1988, and tie the German's open era record of 22 major wins.
Williams, who turns 34 next month, replaces Martina Navratilova as the oldest Wimbledon champion in the open era, and the nine-time winner was among several former champions watching history made from the Royal Box.
The weight of those achievements had appeared to be taking its toll on Williams when she refused to discuss the potential 'slam' during interviews, and the American started the final nervously.
Three double faults contributed to her fearsome serve being broken in the opening game and 20th seed Muguruza was swinging freely in her first major final.
At 0-30 down in the third game, Williams was looking at falling a double-break behind, only for Muguruza to miss a second-serve return.
It sparked Williams into life and she began to exert pressure on the Spaniard's serve with a succession of returns that clipped the baseline.
Four games in a row brought her the set and, despite making her fourth and fifth double faults on a mixed serving day, Williams moved to the brink of victory with a run of 12 points in a row.
What followed brought the Centre Court crowd to life as the 20-time Grand Slam champion was broken to love at 5-2, and then remarkably pegged back again when Muguruza saved a match point and fired a forehand winner on her fifth break point for 5-4.
Williams was now struggling but she got a helping hand from her opponent, who opened game 10 with a double fault and soon found herself 0-40 down.
When Muguruza sent the ball wide on match point it appeared that Williams was unsure whether or not she had won, and it took the reaction of the 15,000 spectators to confirm her achievement.
""I can't believe I am standing here with another 'Serena Slam',"" added Williams.
""It is so cool. It has been a pleasure and an honour to give so many years in this unbelievable place.""",Serena Williams beat Spain's Garbine Muguruza to win Wimbledon for the sixth time and complete the 'Serena Slam' as the holder of all four major titles.,33493623
158,"Mr Yatsenyuk told the BBC the central challenge for the newly named government was to ""stabilise"" Ukraine.
Ukrainian MPs are expected to vote later on the new cabinet line up.
Meanwhile, the regional parliament and government headquarters in Crimea have been seized by armed men.
The two buildings in the regional capital Simferopol were seized overnight by a group of at least 50 pro-Russian men who were preventing government workers from entering, regional Prime Minister Anatoliy Mohilyov told AFP news agency.
The Russian flag was seen flying over both buildings.
Mr Yatsenyuk and Ukraine's other new ministers were presented to a large crowd at Kiev's Independence Square, the Maidan, on Wednesday evening.
Mr Yatsenyuk, who was one of the main protest leaders, was greeted with cheers.
But the announcement of some other heads of ministries, including Interior Minister Arsen Avakov, prompted booing from the crowd, who said the candidates were not worthy of government posts.
Other ministers include career diplomat Andriy Deschytsya as foreign minister, a former deputy head of the central bank  Oleksander Shlapak as finance minister and Andriy Paruby as secretary of the National Security and Defence Council.
""We are to undertake extremely unpopular steps as the previous government and previous president were so corrupted that the country is in a desperate financial plight,"" Mr Yatsenyuk told the BBC after the cabinet was announced.
""We are on the brink of a disaster and this is the government of political suiciders. So welcome to hell,"" he added.
The 39-year-old, who is a former speaker of parliament and foreign minister, is expected to lead the cabinet until early presidential elections on 25 May.
Interim President Turchynov warned the crowds the new government would ""have to pass unpopular decisions"".
""The government will be criticised, treated like dirt. But they must fulfil their obligations and work to the bone for the sake of Ukraine.""
He has promised to resign once the country is back on its feet.
Acting government officials predict Ukraine needs $35bn (Â£21bn) in bailout loans to get through the next two years.
On Wednesday, the US said it was considering offering Ukraine's struggling economy - which faces default - loan guarantees of up to $1bn.

What next for Ukraine?
Meanwhile, Mr Yanukovych has been put on the international wanted list.
The fugitive former president - whose whereabouts are unclear - is accused of being behind last week's deaths of more than 100 protesters at the hands of riot police in and around the Maidan.
In Simferopol, armed men seized the Crimean government buildings after the city saw clashes on Wednesday between Ukrainians who support the change of government and pro-Russian activists.
An elderly man died from a suspected heart attack after scuffles between members of a pro-Russian rally and a second rally involving Crimean Tatars and supporters of the new government.
Asked in a BBC interview whether Ukraine would stay united despite the growing tensions, Mr Yatsenyuk said: ""In Crimea we always had different sentiments and forces who try to split the country and proclaim separatism."" But he said Ukraine ""could cope"".
Crimea was transferred from Russia to Ukraine in 1954.
Russia, along with the US, UK and France, pledged to uphold the territorial integrity of Ukraine in a memorandum signed in 1994.
US Secretary of State John Kerry has again warned Russia any military intervention in Ukraine would be a ""grave mistake"".
His remarks came after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a snap drill to test the combat readiness of troops in central and western Russia, near the border with Ukraine.
Amidst heightened tensions between Russia and the West, Nato has issued a statement saying it would continue to support Ukraine's territorial integrity.
Unrest in Ukraine first erupted in November, following Mr Yanukovych's last-minute decision to reject a landmark association and trade deal with the European Union in favour of Russia's bailout offer.

160,"Unsurprisingly, his remarks divided opinion on every front: their length; setting; and substantive content - or lack thereof. Here are some of the most prominent media responses.
In a mostly supportive editorial, the New York Times said Mr Obama had ""issued a strong and timely challenge"" to the US congress to approve new legal authorisation for the ongoing military campaign against IS.
The paper also commended the president for warning Americans against turning on one another: ""Mr Obama is right to caution against the risk of further alienating Muslims in the United States and around the world,"" it said.
It did, however, criticise the president for saying ""nothing during his remarks about improving the administration's efforts to counter the Islamic State's highly prodigious propaganda operation, which has found a receptive audience among disaffected Muslims around the world"".
Christian Whiton, a former State Department senior advisor to George W Bush during his presidency and regular Fox News contributor, devoted a large portion of his response to the issue of gun control.
He said Mr Obama, in once again criticising the nation's gun laws, was ""attempting one of his trademark shifts in blame.
""Even if his proposed ban and other gun control measures were in place, they would not have stopped the attack in San Bernardino. Recent attacks like those in Paris show that jihadists have little problem overcoming gun laws, which serve mainly to disarm the law-abiding.""
Despite Mr Obama's entreaty for people to not foster division between the US and Islam, Mr Whiton wrote that the US needed to ""fight back in the cultural and ideological war radical Islam is waging against us, and defend rather than blame the American people"".
Charlie Spiering, writing for the right-wing news site Breitbart News, was critical of what he saw as a focus on domestic issues over defeating IS.
He wrote: ""Obama's speech... did not include any new steps to defeat radical Islamic extremism, but focused on what Americans should not do in response to the unavoidable resurgent fear of terrorism under his leadership.""
James Fallows, writing in the liberal Atlantic Monthly, praised Mr Obama for his apparent understanding that the US cannot eliminate terrorism, nor wholly protect its citizens from it. But Mr Fallows said he recognised why a temperate approach had provoked accusations of weakness.
""Obama's lucidity about confronting an evil, and working strategically against it without taking its bait, is something I greatly respect in him. But this same bloodless-seeming logic is the trait that led to the post-speech complaints about his coldness, his dispassion, his inability to offer something new.""
Edward-Isaac Dovere, writing for Politico, said Mr Obama's intended pep talk had been ""not-so-peppy"".
""Obama's cool, calm 'I got this' air helped get him elected in 2008. Seven years later, it's clear that many Americans don't want reassurance, but want him to convey the sense of urgency that they're feeling. Aides were hoping that he'd be able to.""
Echoing Mr Fallows' comments, the Guardian's South Asia correspondent and expert on jihadism Jason Burke said the Obama administration privately recognised that degrading IS is ""significantly more likely than destroying"" it, but also knew that the fact ""cannot be publicly admitted in the face of vituperative Republican criticism"".
Mr Burke said the president's comments ""signalled a shift"" in the administration's stance on extremism and the wider faith of Islam.
""He did not say that Isis [another term for the Islamic State group] has nothing to do with Islam. Not only did he say 'denying that an extremist ideology has spread within some Muslim communities' would be a mistake, but added that 'it's a real problem that Muslims must confront without excuse'.""
From the Wall Street Journal: ""The Oval Office address, which is the most sobering communications tool a president has, underscores how serious the issue has become for both the White House and the increasingly unsettled country.""
Michael D Shear in the New York Times: ""Some of Mr. Obama's media advisers have long believed that sitting behind the desk in the Oval Office, as presidents like Ronald Reagan usually did, is no longer an effective image in a fast-paced, YouTube world... But there is also history to think about, and there is no doubt that the Oval Office backdrop conveys the historic nature of a moment.""
Edward-Isaac Dovere in Politico: ""Giving the speech from the Oval Office ""conveys the seriousness with which we are taking the issue,"" a senior administration official said Sunday afternoon, ahead of Obama's remarks. Americans would see Obama in ""a familiar and appropriate venue,"" the official said, ""from the place where he makes his decisions.""
The New York Daily News has been running an in-your-face campaign in favour of stricter gun controls. The day after the San Bernardino shooting it used the entire front page to criticise Republican politicians who offered prayers for the victims while obstructing gun control measures.

161,"Close to 90,000 fans will be at Wembley for the 134th final of the world's oldest cup competition as two teams of elite, millionaire sportsmen battle it out for glory.
But what exactly was the scene at the original final way back in 1872?
An estimated crowd of 2,000 were there to see 22 amateurs play on a cricket pitch, with no nets, as Wanderers beat Royal Engineers 1-0 thanks to a goal from Morton Betts.
BBC Sport, with the help of Matthew Taylor, professor of history at De Montfort University, look at the first final 143 years ago...
Prior to the 1872 FA Cup, there were no regular competitive games being played in England. Football Association secretary Charles Alcock drew up plans for the first FA Cup which saw 15 teams enter the first round of November 1871.
Step forward Barnes, Civil Service, Hitchin, Crystal Palace (confusingly not the present-day Palace but their precursors who were dissolved in 1876), Maidenhead, Marlow, Queen's Park, Donington School, Upton Park, Clapham Rovers, Royal Engineers, Reigate Priory, Wanderers, Harrow Chequers and Hampstead Heathens, who were given a bye.
Teething problems and the logistical headaches of scheduling football matches across Britain in the era of steam meant that Scottish side Queen's Park advanced to the semi-finals without actually playing a game.
The semi-finals - both goalless draws - were played at the Kennington Oval. The Royal Engineers booked their place in the final with a 3-0 replay win over Crystal Palace, while Wanderers made it through when Queen's Park decided they could not afford another costly trip to London for the replay and withdrew.
The historian's view: ""The general consensus is that the FA Cup was based on the knockout competitions between 'Houses' at major public schools such as Harrow. But Alcock may also have taken inspiration from existing competitions in the provinces, such as Sheffield's Youdon Cup, launched in 1867.
""Certainly football was equally, if not more, established and popular in Sheffield as it was in London at this time, and the elite ex-public schoolboys based in the capital knew and played against teams from Sheffield, Nottingham and elsewhere.""
Alcock - the brains behind the whole idea - played in defence for Wanderers.
Formed in 1859 as Forest Football Club, the side mainly consisted of former Harrow public schoolboys and took the name 'Wanderers' because they played their matches at different grounds. But by 1869 the club was based at the Kennington Oval, where Alcock also happened to be the secretary of Surrey cricket club.
The Royal Engineers were founded in 1863 by Major Francis Marindin - an extraordinary man. Having served in the Crimean war, he would go on to play in the 1872 final, become president of the FA in 1874 and then referee eight further FA Cup finals.
The 1872 final was held at Kennington Oval, also the venue for the first international football match between England and Scotland in 1870.
The Oval would go on to host 20 of the next 21 FA Cup finals, with the 1873 final played at Lillie Bridge - close to Chelsea's modern home at Stamford Bridge.
The historian's view: ""Many football clubs played on cricket grounds in the late 19th century. Football clubs often emerged from existing cricket clubs, as a way of the players keeping fit in the winter. Purpose-built football grounds did not emerge in significant numbers until the 1880s and 1890s.""
While fans at this year's final will have to battle through the crowds at Wembley, it was a more sedate affair in 1872. Football had yet to catch on and around 2,000 are said to have been at the Oval.
Much has changed beyond recognition in football but the cost of attending remains an issue...
The historian's view: ""Attendances for football matches were not large in the early 1870s, with one reason for the relatively low attendance the price of tickets, which at one shilling (five pence in today's money) was higher than for most matches at the time.
""The Oval crowd was said to be 'very fashionable', so presumably made up of the well-to-do and the upper middle-class, as well as those connected with the 'old boys' public school network that ran the Football Association at this time.""
The Royal Engineers could lay claim to being the Barcelona of their day, with their revolutionary tactic of 'passing' the ball to a team-mate at odds with the usual approach of chasing the ball into space.
The only goal of the final came after 15 minutes when Betts, playing under the pseudonym ""A H Chequer"", derived from his membership of the Harrow Chequers club, collected the ball after a long dribble from Walpole Vidal and slammed home.
Goalkeeper was not yet a specialist position, with keepers regularly playing outfield.
The historian's view: ""It was not unusual for teams to line up with six or seven forwards in the early 1870s. Most teams at this time still relied primarily on individual dribbling, with team-mates backing up the dribbler in an effort to move the ball towards the opponents' goal.
""Some authorities have claimed that the Royal Engineers were the first team to develop a passing game, and were doing so at around the time of the first FA Cup final.""
It's fair to say that the footballers of Oscar Wilde's age were a different breed to today's sporting stars.
The Wanderers' band of ex-public schoolboys and the aristocratic elite produced some notable sportsmen. As well as the pioneering Alcock the team contained several men who played first-class cricket, a goalkeeper who was capped by England as a defender and a forward who was capped by England in goal.
Forward Edward Bowen was noted for walking the 90 miles between Cambridge and Oxford in 26 hours in between his football and playing cricket for Hampshire; full-back Edgar Lubbock went on to become the deputy governor of the Bank of England and wing-wizard Walpole Vidal - known as the ""prince of dribblers"" - would later become a vicar.
As you would expect, the Royal Engineers side had all seen military service from across the world, with experiences branching from India to the Crimea, Bermuda, Gibraltar and the Zulu war.
Forward Henry Waugh Renny-Tailyour played football and rugby union for Scotland as well as cricket for Kent and would still find time to become a managing director of Guinness, while half-back Alfred Goodwyn would suffer the unfortunate fate of being the first international footballer to be killed in a riding accident in India two years after the final.
The historian's view: ""Most of the players in the first final had learnt the game in elite public schools and at university. The Wanderers was open only to those who had attended leading public schools and Oxbridge. Three of the Cup final line-up had attended Eton and four had gone to Harrow.""
The early rules were very different. In a nod to cricket, players had to appeal for a goal and changed ends after each goal, not at half-time. This once allowed Walpole Vidal to score three times without the opposition touching the ball.
The historian's view: ""Modern fans would be surprised by some of the features of football in 1872. Rather than a crossbar, a tape was pitched between two posts eight feet above the ground.
""Throw-ins were not determined by the team whose player had kicked the ball off the pitch but by the first player to reach the ball. But these rules were not consistent across the country. Variations existed in different areas and it was not until 10 years later, in 1882, that a uniform set of rules was established by the FA.""
The 2015 final will be refereed by Jon Moss, who can expect some grief from the stands. It was a different story for civil servant Alfred Stair, the referee chosen for the first three FA Cup finals. Stair was the head of the Inland Revenue - presumably seen as a trustworthy gentleman of his day - and also played football for Upton Park.
The historian's view: ""In the earliest days of football, referees were literally peripheral figures. They stood outside the playing area and were only called upon to adjudicate if the umpires (who were appointed by each club and stood in either half of the pitch) could not reach agreement.""
For winners Wanderers it was the start of a golden - if brief - era of success. They retained the trophy in 1873 by beating Oxford University 2-0 and added three more trophies before the end of the decade. Their haul of five FA Cups has only been bettered by Blackburn Rovers, Newcastle, Aston Villa, Chelsea, Liverpool, Tottenham, Manchester United and Arsenal.
But by 1881 Wanderers could not field a side as players left to play for some of the newer clubs springing up across the country and the team folded in 1887. A reformed side was founded in 2009 and the club currently play in the Surrey South Eastern Combination. In fact they are looking for a new manager to get the club back in the FA Cup by 2022.
The Engineers reached four finals and won the Cup in 1875. They continue to play on and are currently managed by Capt Simon Mayers, who has a 25-man squad to select from around 8,000 men based around the world.
The historian's view: ""Football became increasingly popular over the next decade or so, as it became embedded in British working-class culture. Its popularity was helped by entrepreneurs who realised the opportunities that existed in enclosing playing fields and charging the public for entry.
""The next step from this, as teams began to act as representatives of their localities, was for ambitious club committees to 'poach' the best players and pay for them to play for their teams. Within less than a decade of the first FA Cup final, professional football had emerged in England, though it was not legalised by the FA until 1885.""",Saturday's FA Cup final between Arsenal and Aston Villa at Wembley will be watched by half a billion viewers in more than 120 countries.,29458784
162,"The US agency's current policy prohibits anyone working for it who has used cannabis in the past three years.
However, its director James Comey has acknowledged that this is complicating its efforts to recruit hacking experts, according to the Wall Street Journal.
It said he made the announcement at a conference in New York.
""I have to hire a great workforce to compete with those cybercriminals, and some of those kids want to smoke weed on the way to the interview,"" the newspaper quoted him as saying at the White Collar Crime Institute's annual meeting.
It added that when one attendee asked how a cannabis-using friend interested in working for the bureau should now act, Mr Comey replied: ""He should go ahead and apply.""
A spokeswoman for the FBI confirmed Mr Comey had discussed cannabis in unscripted remarks during a question and answer session after his speech at the conference.
However, during a committee hearing at the Senate on Wednesday the FBI director subsequently said he had been trying to be ""philosophic and funny"" when he made the comments.
""I don't want young people to use marijuana. It's against the law,"" he added.
""I did not say that I'm going to change that ban. I said I have to grapple with the change in my workforce.""
Unlike the FBI, the UK's National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU)'s vetting policy does not make specific reference to cannabis, but does have a wider anti-drugs rule.
""Whilst previous drug taking is not necessarily a barrier to employment provided people are open about it, applicants are told not to apply if they have taken illegal drugs in the preceding 12 months,"" said a spokeswoman for the National Crime Agency, of which the NCCU is a division.
""Before joining all new entrants have to undertake a drugs screening test before appointment is confirmed.
""Once employed, individuals are subject to NCA policies including random and intelligence-led 'with cause' substance testing. Certain high-risk posts require individuals to take more regular testing as a role requirement.""
One expert thought it was sensible to review such anti-drugs policies.
""The sort of hackers that you want to hire tend to be young, the young tend to have bad habits such as smoking marijuana, and over time you'd expect them to do this less,"" Dr Richard Clayton, from the University of Cambridge's Computer Laboratory, told the BBC.
""But equally, I believe the FBI and the National Cyber Crime Unit have more problem recruiting people because of the salaries they pay, which compare poorly with the salaries available in the private industry.""
The UK's Defence Secretary Philip Hammond told BBC Two's Newsnight programme in November that the NCCU might hire convicted hackers despite a current ban against recruits with a criminal record.
""The conviction would be examined in terms of how long ago it was, how serious it was, what sort of sentence had followed. So I can't rule it out,"" he said.
But Dr Clayton said he was concerned how this might be implemented.
""We like to send out the message that hacking is very bad and that if you get caught it can ruin your life,"" he said.
""But it's a problem if you then say, 'If you get caught we might let you serve a few months in jail and then give you a nice cushy job.'
""Perhaps we might want to have some sort of 'we won't hire you until your conviction is at least five years old' sort of policy.""","The FBI has reportedly said it is ""grappling with the question"" of whether to hire cybersecurity experts who use cannabis.",27499595
163,"That protein may be responsible for itching, swelling and rashes suffered by people taking a wide range of medicines.
Such reactions stop people completing treatments and can sometimes be fatal.
Writing in the journal Nature, scientists say they are exploring ways to block the protein and reduce these side-effects.
Researchers from the Johns Hopkins University, in Maryland, and the University of Alberta focused on reactions triggered by medicines prescribed for a number of conditions - from diabetes to HIV.
These reactions, also seen after some antibiotics or anti-cancer treatments, can spark a range of symptoms from redness to rashes.
They are different to the allergic reactions caused by food and those experienced by hay fever sufferers.
Scientists tested mice with and without a single protein - named MRGPRB2 - on their cells.
Mice without the protein did not suffer any redness, rashes or swelling despite being given drugs known to provoke reactions.
And changes in blood pressure and heart rate - hallmarks of potentially dangerous reactions - were reduced.
Dr Benjamin McNeil, at John Hopkins University School of Medicine, said: ""It's fortunate that all of the drugs turn out to trigger a single receptor - it makes that receptor an attractive drug target.""
And if a new drug to block the protein receptor could be made, Dr McNeil said, this would help reduce the side-effects many patients currently endured.
Maureen Jenkins, clinical director of Allergy UK, said: ""Allergic disease affects the immune system and the reactions are often very complex.
""All new methods to try and understand these reactions and to develop target treatments are welcomed.""
Scientists are now investigating whether the same protein could be behind certain skin conditions - such as rosacea and psoriasis.
These conditions can result in patches of redness and rashes, but their cause is currently unknown.","Allergic reactions to drugs and injections could stem from one single protein, research in mice suggests.",30517147

In her spare time, Maggie acts with Belfast's Belvoir Players amateur drama company.
But this year, she'll be one of the stars in the Royal Shakespeare Company's touring production of 'A Midsummer Night's Dream.'
""I think it's the biggest opportunity I'm ever really going to get,"" she said.
""I'm not looking to make this my big career in life - I like the slow pace of amateur dramatics - but this is the one big chance to bring some excitement into it, and some real professionalism.""
In all, six actors from Belvoir Players have been chosen by the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) for the roles of 'the mechanicals' in the play.
They are an integral part of the comedy, as they gather to rehearse a play in honour of a royal wedding.
When a fairy called Puck discovers their rehearsal, he casts a spell and all manner of mischief results.
Most of the laughs are at the expense of the character of Nick Bottom, who is played by another amateur from Belfast, management consultant Trevor Gill.
""Not in our wildest dreams have we ever said to ourselves that one day the Belvoir Players amateur theatre company from Belfast would stand toe-to-toe with the professionals of the RSC,"" he said.
""Not in a million years did we think we'd have this opportunity, it's really quite amazing.""
The local cast are one of 14 amateur groups across the UK chosen to join the production in 2016 as it tours the UK to mark the 400th anniversary of William Shakespeare's death.
They are the only participants from Northern Ireland to take part, but they are getting expert help ahead of their time in the spotlight.
RSC Associate Director Kimberley Sykes has travelled to Belfast for rehearsals, and they are also getting advice from the professional members of the cast via videolink.
Ms Sykes said it was the chance of a lifetime for amateur actors, giving them the chance to perform alongside some of the finest stage actors in the world.
""Some of them have said it's a death bed moment.
""The moment you remember the birth of your children, your wedding day, and the moment you played on the RSC stage in A Midsummer Night's Dream.
""It's probably one of Shakespeare's more well-known plays, as a lot of people have studied it at school so they'll recognise some of the characters,"" said Ms Sykes.
""It's a play about love, about celebration, about festivities, so there's something in there for everybody.""
The local cast will join the RSC on the stage of the Grand Opera House in Belfast from 31 May - 4 June.
They then move across the Irish sea for three performances in July.
""Just to put the cap on it,"" said Trevor Gill, ""we will then go to the RSC's theatre in Stratford-Upon-Avon.""
""When you think of some of the actors who have set foot on that stage, like Laurence Olivier or Judi Dench, for us just to be there as members of the cast is absolutely amazing.""
The local actors will work intensively for the next few months to be ready for their big roles, but Trevor admits there is only one slight downside to what lies ahead.
""It's sometimes difficult to get on with your day job, because you think to yourself 'Blimey, in five months time I'm going to be acting with the Royal Shakespeare Company.""

165,"A 75% majority was required to pass the changes, demanded by sports minister Tracey Crouch to make governing bodies more independent and diverse.
As part of the deal, a board place will be created for the 10 English regions.
""The vote is the start of an exciting new chapter,"" said British Cycling's chief executive Julie Harrington.
""Securing funding will enable us to inspire more people onto two wheels.""
Funding agency Sport England had allocated £17m to British Cycling to boost grassroots participation, while UK Sport is set to invest £26m for its Olympic and Paralympic teams' preparations for Tokyo 2020.
However, the government deemed that, from November, boards of governing bodies must be ""the ultimate decision-making body and exercise all of the powers of the organisation"" - something that former chief executive Peter King thought would be rejected by more than 25% of British Cycling's 130,000 members.
British Cycling executives - including president Bob Howden and chairman Jonathan Browning - attended a series of regional meetings in a bid to convince members to support the reforms.
The reforms included an increase in the number of openly recruited independent board members from three to four and an independent chair. They also included a limit for directors of three three-year terms, with six of the eight elected members on the current board being forced to stand down.
British six-time Olympic champion Sir Chris Hoy had written to urge them to accept the proposals.
And Howden warned that cycling ""could be lost to an entire generation"" if their Sport England funding was withdrawn.
British Cycling said the reforms were voted through by 94% of its members and the result was welcomed in a joint statement from Sport England and UK Sport.
""We are very pleased to see that British Cycling members voted in favour of proposed governance reforms,"" the organisations said.
""National governing bodies of sport in receipt of public funding have a huge responsibility to invest it wisely and with transparency, and the code was launched to ensure those organisations have the highest standards of leadership.
""Some of the proposed reforms will involve significant changes, so today's vote from the members is a strong demonstration of British Cycling's commitment to continuous improvement to benefit everyone involved in the sport.""
Julian Knight MP, who sits on the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, said British Cycling has ""stared into the abyss and decided not to jump"".
He added: ""I trust this will provide a wake-up call to the sport that success doesn't give it a free pass. It must strive for the highest standards in governance and how athletes are treated.""
To date, the government has had mixed results persuading sports to adopt its Code for Sports Governance, designed to improve governance standards across sport.
In May, the Football Association's council finally approved reforms, having been threatened with a £15m funding cut.
But earlier this month, the national governing body for table tennis became the first to reject the government's standards and had its full £9m Sport England funding award suspended as a result.",British Cycling will retain £43m in public funding after its national council approved governance reforms in an extraordinary general meeting.,40692580
166,"Claim: Donald Trump was quizzed at the start of the debate on his obscene comments about women made in 2005. He went on the offensive with a series of claims - including this one - about women who have alleged sexual assault or obscene behaviour by Bill Clinton.
Reality Check verdict: Bill Clinton did pay out the money to Paula Jones but it was not a fine. In 1999, the then-president reached an out-of-court settlement with Ms Jones, an Arkansas government employee who claimed he had exposed himself to her in a hotel room eight years earlier, when he was governor of Arkansas. He paid Ms Jones $850,000 for agreeing to drop the case but did not offer an apology. Almost half of this sum came from the Clintons' family savings.
Ms Jones had sued Mr Clinton for sexual harassment. It was this case that led to the investigation in which then-President Clinton denied under oath having sex with Monica Lewinsky.
'Mrs Clinton was no longer secretary of state for President Obama's 'red line' in Syria'
Claim: Hillary Clinton had left President Barack Obama's government by the time he drew a ""red line in the sand"" over the use of chemical weapons by President Bashar al-Assad's forces in Syria.
""First of all, she was there as secretary of state with the so-called line in the sand,"" said Mr Trump during Sunday's debate. ""No I wasn't. I was gone,"" Mrs Clinton responded.
""At some point, we need to do some fact-checking here,"" she added. Mr Trump then went on: ""You were in total contact with the White House, and perhaps, sadly, Obama probably still listened to you.""
Reality Check verdict: Mrs Clinton was secretary of state when Mr Obama made his ""red line"" comment in August 2012. She stayed in office until February 2013.
In fact, she repeated Mr Obama's comment several times, including at a news conference in Prague in December 2012 when she said: ""We have made our views very clear. This is a red line for the United States. I'm not going to telegraph in any specifics what we would do in the event of credible evidence that the Assad regime has resorted to using chemical weapons against his own people, but suffice to say we are certainly planning to take action if that eventuality were to occur.""
However, when the ""red line"" was crossed and more than 1,000 people died in a chemical attack in Damascus in August 2013, Mrs Clinton was no longer the secretary of state. She had been replaced by John Kerry.
Claim: Donald Trump attacks Hillary Clinton over her record on defending women's rights.
Reality Check verdict: It would be a stretch to say Clinton was laughing at the victim. Trump was referring to a case from the mid-1980s, when Mrs Clinton was working as a lawyer. She defended a factory worker accused of raping a 12-year-old girl.
In unpublished audio recordings of an interview she had with an Arkansas reporter, she is heard laughing four times while discussing the trial. In one instance she says: ""Of course he [the defendant] claimed he didn't [rape her]…He took a lie detector test. I had him take a polygraph, which he passed, which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs"". Clinton and the reporter are then heard laughing.
The accused ultimately admitted a reduced charge and the victim has since said Clinton put ""me through hell"".
'Acid-washed emails'
Claim: Donald Trump claims Hillary Clinton ""acid washed"" 33,000 personal emails to delete them, something he said was an ""expensive process"".
Reality Check verdict: A claim that has been debunked before. The FBI said Clinton's team used a free software programme called BleachBit. No chemicals were used. When he first made this claim, Trump's campaign said that he did not literally mean ""acid washed"", adding that it was a play on words and reference to a joke made by Clinton about ""wiping"" her email server with a cloth. BleachBit debunked Trump's claim on its website saying the software is not ""very expensive,"" adding that it is completely free of charge.
US nukes are 'old' and Russia's are 'new'
Claim: Mr Trump said that the US nuclear programme has fallen way behind that of Russia. The Russians ""have gone wild with their nuclear programme"" he said, and Russia's nukes are ""new"" while America's are ""old"".
Reality Check verdict: Mr Trump has a point.
Even the US Defence Secretary Ash Carter accepted in a speech last month that the US has not built ""new types of nuclear weapons or delivery system for some twenty five years"". He acknowledged that most of America's nuclear weapons delivery systems  ""have already been extended decades beyond their original expected service lives"".
Meanwhile Russia has been modernising, though not at a pace that might be described as going ""wild"". Russia's military doctrine certainly places growing emphasis upon nuclear weapons and it is not only modernising its arsenal, but also making nuclear threats against a number of NATO members. Russia's modernisation effort though is constrained by its budget and it still has many older systems deployed too.
The fact is that the world changed at the end of the Cold War. The emphasis moved away from nuclear deterrence and arms control treaties, prompting significant reductions in the two main nuclear powers' arsenals.
Now things have changed again. As Russia gets more assertive, North Korea quickly develops its nuclear programme and China grows its arsenal, the US is seeking to modernise many of its nuclear systems.
Claim: Donald Trump says he has the backing of 200 military leaders.
Reality Check verdict: This seems overblown. The Trump campaign website, in September, said 88 retired US admirals and generals had signed a letter endorsing the Republican candidate. The BBC covered this at the time - you can read the story here.
Canadians are going to America for operations
Claim: Donald Trump says Canada's universal health care system, which he says is similar to the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, leads to longer waits for operations, with Canadians increasingly travelling to the US ""when they need a big operation"".
Reality Check verdict: There is no readily available data on the number of Canadians travelling to America for medical treatment.
Medical experts also stress that there are several key differences between the US and Canadian healthcare systems, making direct comparisons difficult.
The Trump campaign cited a report by the Fraser Institute think tank, which suggested there was a 25% increase in Canadians travelling abroad for non-emergency medical treatment between 2013 and 2014. The estimate is based on data from an annual survey of Canadian physicians in 12 specialties.

A 2002 Michigan university study, based on data gathered in three US states bordering Canada between 1994 and 1998, found ""surprisingly few"" Canadians travelled to the US for treatment.

Claim: Donald Trump refuses to back down over his claim that he did not support the Iraq War.
Reality Check verdict: It has been debunked. Trump did not publicly speak out against the war before it started. More details from the first debate Reality Check.
Claim: Donald Trump mocks Hillary Clinton for saying she was just quoting from the film Lincoln when she said that politicians should have different positions in public and private. ""Abraham Lincoln never lied - that is the big difference between Abraham Lincoln and you,"" he tells his Democratic rival.
Reality Check verdict: The Clinton quote Trump is referring to - ""you need both a public and a private position"" - comes from an April 2013 speech to the National Multifamily Housing Council. It was one of the paid speeches she gave before launching her presidential bid, which she refused to release, but details of which have now been revealed in leaked emails.
In the speech, she referred the film Lincoln, and the deal-making that went into passage of the 13th Amendment, a process she compared to sausage-making.
She said: ""It is unsavoury, and it always has been that way, but we usually end up where we need to be, but if everybody's watching, you know, all of the back-room discussions and the deals, you know, then people get a little nervous to say the least. So, you need both a public and a private position.''

BBC Radio 5 live football correspondent John Murray worked with Graham Taylor for many years. Here he fondly recalls what life was like on the road with the former England manager.
The first time we were squeezed together in one was for a not-terribly-high-profile match on a Friday night at Brentford. I can still see him bounding up the steps at Griffin Park, wearing a black and white checked jacket, cheerily acknowledging people as he came.
And I remember thinking afterwards that Graham Taylor was everything I hoped he would be. He was good fun, charming, engaging, and he had lots to say about the players, the match and all matters surrounding it. And, off air, he wanted to know all about me.
When I got to know him better, he would always be great company post-match, often late into the evening. I have never actually met his wife, Rita, his children, or his grandchildren, but I feel as though I have because Graham would tell you exactly what was going on in their lives.
He loved all sports, particularly athletics and cricket - Graham actually followed England on tour to South Africa. And, believe it or not, he enjoyed the music of both Vera Lynn and Adele, whose albums he bought.
As a match summariser, I knew that if the game wasn't very good and nothing was happening, Graham was someone you could go off at tangents with, because he had such a wide field of interests. During one such commentary, I remember us discussing how he used to take an annual holiday in Caister-on-Sea, and the merits of that Norfolk seaside town.
But don't go thinking he was a pushover. There was a steely core to Graham Taylor that all winners have, and he always struck me as one of life's natural leaders - I'm convinced that was one of the secrets behind the many successes he had.
Once, when we had lost our ticket in an underground car park in Innsbruck, he very nearly persuaded me to tailgate a car through the barrier. He was extremely disappointed that I pulled up short of causing untold damage!
When I turned up at the airport to fly to Euro 2008, Graham appeared with one foot in a plastic boot. He'd injured it somehow, but rather than withdraw from our broadcast team so close to the finals - which he had been advised to do - he travelled all around Austria and Switzerland in some discomfort but without a word of complaint.
Being under scrutiny as a football manager for most of his life, he could click a switch and go into serious mode at a moment's notice, and what he said carried a real authority.
We were both part of the commentary team in Montenegro for a European Championship qualifier when Wayne Rooney was sent off for kicking out at an opponent.
The next morning we were reporting on it into the Breakfast programme, and though Graham was bleary eyed when he arrived in the room, he sat down, clicked into action, and made perfect sense. I recall thinking that had he still been England manager, he would have answered the questions in exactly the same way.
The way things ended for him with England, and the criticism that came with that, clearly stayed with him. He would often reference it himself and was, sometimes I felt, almost too willing to talk about it.
We would always try to guide Graham away from large gatherings of England fans because of the greater possibility of someone saying something out of turn in those circumstances. On the occasions that did happen, Graham would go and talk to them, and they would inevitably be left feeling rather foolish. Later, though, there would often be a quiet word to you which revealed the hurt was still there.
But it says a great deal about the man that it is for his warm, generous, human qualities that I will remember him best.
Yes, Graham Taylor was everything I hoped he would be.","Graham Taylor and I sat next to one another in commentary boxes here, there and everywhere.",38599166
168,"The coin is being withdrawn from circulation by the Canadian government. From Monday, change must be rounded up or down to the nearest five cents.
The penny's eroded purchasing power is behind its removal, along with rising manufacturing costs, hoarding by households, and the outlay by retailers in handling the coins.
Canada is not the first country to ditch a low denomination coin as inflation reduces its value. Australia, Brazil, and Sweden are among many others to do so.
So, does this trend put the UK's 1p coin at risk? Do these coins just sit in a pot at home? Can anything be bought with a penny anyway?
The 1p coin is by far the most common coin in the UK. There were 11.3 billion in circulation, according to the latest figures from The Royal Mint, accounting for nearly 40% of all coins in the system.
Strolling around the streets of Hastings in East Sussex with a pocket full of pennies, it can be tough to find somewhere to spend them.
The old-fashioned shove penny games in the seaside amusement arcades only accept 2p pieces, with the tempting prize of - more coins.

An accordion player busking in an underpass is happy to accept some loose change, but shoppers are less interested in filling their wallets with them.
""One pence and five pence pieces are a pain in the rear end,"" says one man taking a tea break.
Surely the traditional sweet shop, with its pear drops and lollipops in the window, will still be selling penny chews?
""They generally cost more now - about 2p or 3p each,"" says Jerome Franklin-Ryan, specialist at The Sweet Shop and Tobacconist. ""That's inflation in action.
""People still come in with pennies to spend, but we tend to sell things by weight now. We do pester them for their pennies so we can give it out in change.""
Mr Franklin-Ryan might even be sitting on an alternative currency. In New Zealand, one, two and five cent coins have all been removed from circulation. Many shops offer sweets, instead of small change, as a result.
In his role as ""Master of the Mint"", the Chancellor - currently George Osborne - makes decisions over the detail of coins. In 2010, he announced that Â£10m a year would be saved by making coins with steel covered in nickel plating, rather than copper.
Mr Osborne has just hired Canada's central bank governor, Mark Carney, as the next boss of the Bank of England. Yet, even in that role, Mr Carney will not have the power to withdraw the penny - even if he sees Canada's move as a success.
The power over the 1p coin's future lies with the people, according to Alec Chrystal, emeritus professor of money and banking at the Cass Business School.
""It will be driven by demand, rather than supply. If we do not use them, then they will drop out of circulation,"" he says.
""There are still plenty of places around that need them, not least charities which might well be upset if they were to go.""
Some analysts have suggested that the 2p - the third largest sized coin in the currency - might be more at risk of withdrawal.
But Prof Chrystal says that in general the smallest denomination coin is the most likely to disappear as habits change, but not for a while yet.
""Cash is still widely used. In terms of volume, a remarkably high proportion is still used,"" he says.
The number of cash payments made in the UK in 2011 was more than double the number of transactions made by card, data from the Payments Council shows.
This is primarily the result of the popularity of cash for low-value transactions. In terms of value, more is now spent on debit cards alone than in cash. There are fewer high value transactions, but these tend to be made on plastic.
One retailer where you might expect a keen interest in the future of the penny is 99p Stores.
""It is actually a myth that we give out lots and lots of pennies. In fact, people tend to buy four or five items so we give out more 5p and 2p pieces,"" says co-founder Hussein Lalani.

He says that the cost of handling coins can be higher for retailers, the lower the denomination. Meanwhile, he says retailers and customers are feeling the squeeze, given the state of the economy.
""I do feel that people are hanging around for their change a bit more since the recession,"" he adds.
These shoppers might be penny-pinching, or penny-wise and pound-foolish. These are two of the many expressions that the penny has given to the English language.
Other informal phrases include ""a pretty penny"" to define a considerable sum of money, and ""when the penny drops"" to explain that somebody has finally understood something.
The withdrawal of the Canadian penny brings a long history to an end. It was introduced with the decimal system in 1858 and was struck at mints in England until 1908.
Since then, some 35 billion pennies have been struck at the Ottawa branch of The Royal Mint - half of them in the last 20 years.
The UK 1p coin was introduced into circulation on 15 February, 1971, when the country adopted decimalisation. It had the word ""new"" struck on the back of the coin to avoid any confusion with old pennies. This was stopped in 1982.
Such a short history, and large circulation, means that the 1p coin is unlikely to have any collectable value, says coin dealer Peter Nichols, of St Leonards, near Hastings.
""You would have to keep them for a very, very long time,"" he says. ""They are just scrap metal.""
He says he has people coming in with Â£50 bags of old pennies, which are not worth anything for collectors.
His view is that people should keep the 50p coins that commemorate the Olympics, as they might eventually be worth something.
One thing is certain for the humble 1p piece. The effect of inflation means it is always losing the race to maintain its value.",Go shopping at any shop in Canada and you may notice that something is missing in your change - the one penny or cent.,21292441

From 1 April, the region will start making its own decisions to ""provide the foundations"" for a Greater Manchester health and social care strategy.

""I am excited about all this because not only does it mean the people of Greater Manchester having more control over the decisions that affect their lives, I believe it will also lead to better, much more joined-up health care.

The agreement is part of the government's northern powerhouse plan to close the economic gap between north and south by investing in regions.
The plan would see local leaders, and ultimately Greater Manchester's new directly elected mayor, control how budgets are allocated.
Deputy leader of Greater Manchester Combined Authority Sir Richard Leese said: ""The first big change is to make sure that a lot of people aren't entering into needing healthcare that don't need to do so.""

The chief executive of NHS England Simon Stevens quipped that ""we are now signing the nuptials"". For some of us, it felt more like a renewal of the vows.
Last November, the chancellor signed the UK's first ""devolution deal"" - but this may be a bigger deal, as Greater Manchester becomes a testbed for NHS devolution.
But the congregation in the Town Hall may have noticed a lack of Labour MPs - this deal has exposed a division between Labour's local authority leadership and its Westminster team.
The shadow health secretary Andy Burnham, who's long championed integration, called it a ""two-tier system"" and his colleague, Wigan MP Lisa Nandy, said it showed ""complete contempt"" for local people.
They believe there's a lack of democratic oversight.  They were also politically exposed, unaware this major agreement was being negotiated.
The chief executive of Manchester City Council, Sir Howard Bernstein - perhaps taking the role of Best Man - told me the NHS won't be controlled by any future mayor but by a new health board of council leaders and local NHS managers.
Other council leaders, including the Mayor of Liverpool Joe Anderson, are left wishing they had been invited to a similar ceremony.
Ann Barnes, chief executive of Stockport NHS Foundation Trust, said: ""It is not about increasing power, but about increasing the health and prosperity of local people.
""We will have greater opportunities to respond swiftly and effectively to the needs of residents and really transform services for them. They will have a powerful voice in a powerful partnership.""
NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens described the memorandum of understanding as a ""landmark agreement"".
""[It] charts a path to the greatest integration and devolution of care funding since the creation of the NHS in 1948,"" he said.

173,"Erin Bisson, from Jersey, launched legal action for discrimination against Condor Ferries after a member of staff told her to use a disabled loo.
She had also said the use of words rather than symbols on toilets amounted to indirect discrimination.
The firm admitted discrimination at the island's Employment and Discrimination Tribunal on Friday.
In its first decision taken since the island introduced gender discrimination laws in 2015, the tribunal found Ms Bisson's complaints against Condor of direct and indirect discrimination because of her gender reassignment to be ""well-founded"".
When she called the company in September to ask which toilets she should use, Ms Bisson said a staff member ""advised me I should be using the disabled toilets"".
She claimed this had amounted to direct discrimination.
Condor, which sails between Poole, Portsmouth, France and the Channel Islands, admitted to a ""non-intentional and non-malicious act of discrimination"".
Ms Bisson has since approved changes to the Condor toilets which now have symbols representing men and women, and not words. Male and female toilets are still separate.
""Gender is down to identity, symbols is one way of dealing with this"", she said.
Condor Ferries said it had worked with Ms Bisson to draw up a list of measures ""to remove the possibility of inadvertent discrimination"", which it had implemented after approval from Ms Bisson and the tribunal.
""As the first ruling about transgender discrimination, this sets the direction for future tribunals to follow,"" said advocate Caroline Dutot, an employment and discrimination law specialist in Jersey.

Dimmock joined the BBC as head of outside broadcasts in 1946, and was responsible for bringing the Queen's coronation to the nation's screens.
A former Royal Air Force flight lieutenant, he worked for the Press Association before 31 years at the BBC.
BBC director general Tony Hall described Dimmock as a ""true pioneer"".
He added: ""As the man who oversaw coverage of the Queen's coronation, he was also responsible for a seminal moment in British broadcasting history.
""Peter's broadcasting mirrored the man - charming, warm, and authoritative.""
Former BBC One controller Sir Paul Fox said Dimmock had ""introduced the British public to television"" and ""led BBC Sport to some of its greatest successes"".
He said: ""He persuaded the people who mattered that the coronation of the Queen should be televised, thereby ensuring the arrival of television in this country.
""More than 20 million watched the coronation, the majority outside their homes. Within 12 months, television licences had doubled.""
BBC director of sport Barbara Slater said Dimmock had made an ""extraordinary contribution"" to the broadcasting industry.
""He was hugely admired by both the audience and those that worked with him. He will be sadly missed.""
The Queen's coronation at Westminster Abbey on 2 June, 1953 was the largest outside broadcast the BBC had ever undertaken.
It was also the first time a television audience for an event of national importance had exceeded the number of people listening on radio.
Dimmock produced the coverage but later revealed that he had also needed to use his powers of persuasion to be allowed to film the ceremony.
In an interview with the BBC detailing the corporation's history, Dimmock recalled: ""[Prime Minister] Winston Churchill was against it, several of his government were against it and I don't think the Queen was even asked at that stage.
""We performed every trick in the book because people wanted to see and deserved to see the coronation.
""Eventually we persuaded Bernard Norfolk, who organised the coronation, the Queen's press secretary Richard Colville and the Archbishop of Canterbury to let us have a trial of the camera.
""But there was a rule that no camera could be closer than 30 feet from the Queen.
""I got a girl to walk down the aisle as though she was the Queen, but used a two-inch lens - the widest there was - and she looked a mile away. They were happy with that, but what they didn't know was that I was going to use a 12-inch lens that would give the best close up of the Queen that there had ever been.""
In 1954, Dimmock moved from his role as a director and went in front of the camera to present a new sports programme called Sportsview, which became Sportsnight in 1968.
With his distinctive moustache, Dimmock became a familiar face in millions of households.
And, as Dimmock explained, the new venture could not have had a better start.
He added: ""Luck was on our side because on the night of the first edition Roger Bannister was attempting the first sub-four-minute mile in Oxford.
""When he did it, we hired a racing driver to get him back to the studio before the end of the programme. Roger said it was the most horrific car journey he had ever experienced, but we got him there and I interviewed him. That kicked it off to a good start.""
Dimmock was the first presenter of the Sports Personality of the Year award in 1954, which until 1999 was known as Sports Review of the Year.
He also fronted the first coverage of the Grand National in 1960 after persuading Aintree racecourse owner Mirabel Topham to allow the race to be televised after many years of trying.
Two years earlier he had teamed up with producer Paul Fox to launch Grandstand, hosting the first two editions before being replaced by David Coleman.
Dimmock said: ""Paul had this good idea to link live outside broadcasts from a studio so we could give half-time football results, racing results and various items from throughout the afternoon.
""And then, of course, the most important thing of all, the full-time results on the teleprinter with everyone sitting at home with their coupons seeing the results as they came up.

Earlier on Tuesday, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told the BBC that Moscow would sign up to the statement on Syria later in the day.
But he stressed the Kremlin wanted each of the Syrian sides in the talks to select not only their own delegations but the future terms of any transitional government.
Mr Ryabkov sidestepped the question of whether this could leave open a role for President Bashar al-Assad in the future, reports the BBC's Bridget Kendall from the Enniskillen summit.
To try to get as much consensus as possible on Syria, UK Prime Minister David Cameron - who is hosting the summit - held a working dinner on Monday night.

Russia's president fidgeted, looked awkward and moved his neck oddly, his body language screaming that he would be rather be anywhere else than at this summit.
However, they said it would take more work to agree the precise language.
Earlier on Monday, the British had raised the possibility of the other G8 nations issuing an end-of-conference statement without the participation of Russia.
But it now seems that Mr Putin is willing to consider some kind of joint stance, according to officials.
The communique is likely to back the launch of Syrian peace negotiations in Geneva, and insist that humanitarian aid agencies like the Red Cross are given access to all parts of the country.
According to the BBC's UK political editor, Nick Robinson, the issue which is causing most difficulties for the G8 members is what they should say about the transition to a new Syrian government after any new round of peace negotiations.

Can summit live up to ambitious agenda?
Any statement which emerges may not be all that ambitious, correspondents warn - and even then, it is far from certain that any agreement will change the appalling reality in Syria itself.
Ransom deal
The White House announced last week that it would provide military aid to the Syrian rebels. Russia meanwhile supplies weapons to the government of President Bashar al-Assad.
Presidents Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin met for an hour of bilateral talks on Monday, and at a sombre press conference afterwards it was clear they had had a difficult exchange.
Both men acknowledged their differences but said they shared a common desire to stop the bloodshed.
""Of course, our opinions don't coincide. But all of us want to stop the violence and we have agreed to push the parties to the negotiating table,"" Mr Putin told reporters.

As the summit enters its final day, can the leaders find a common form of words on Syria? How bland will their final statement be in order to get agreement? And frankly does it matter what they say here on the shores of Loch Erne in Northern Ireland; the fighting and brutality in Syria seems a world away.
The Russian President Vladimir Putin stands alone in his support for the embattled Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad. But how much does this isolated position really worry Moscow?
A hard won compromise here may have little real substance beyond the world of diplo-speak and political spin.
Nonetheless there is a growing horror at the scale of the humanitarian suffering and a real and growing fear about the Syrian conflict spreading.
Diplomatic consensus among the G8 remains a necessary but insufficient condition to get the  political track moving.
Mr Obama said they had instructed their teams to continue working towards hosting an international conference in Geneva that would aim to find a political solution to end the violence, which the UN says has left more than 93,000 people dead since March 2011.
In a separate interview with US broadcaster PBS, Mr Obama emphasised that ""we're not taking sides in a religious war between Shia and Sunni"" but aiming instead for a ""stable, non-sectarian, representative government"".
His interview coincided with a White House announcement that the US would provide a further $300m (Â£190m) of humanitarian aid for Syrians - split between Syria itself, where more than 4.25 million people have been displaced, and neighbouring countries dealing with the 1.6 million refugees.
In a separate development, Mr Cameron says a commitment has been secured from the G8 governments not to pay ransom to kidnappers.
This refusal has long been UK policy, but privately British officials have often expressed their frustration at alleged ransom payments being made to secure the release of French, Italian and other European hostages seized in the Sahara and elsewhere, reports the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner.
He adds that since those governments have never publicly owned up to paying ransoms, this G8 agreement may be easier to sign than to enforce.","UK PM David Cameron is giving details of a joint statement on Syria, after a two-day G8 summit in Northern Ireland.",22947256

Using the technique, which is used by a growing number of researchers, she has discovered 17 potential pyramids, 3,000 settlements and 1,000 lost tombs in Egypt.
She hopes the technique can now be passed on to citizen scientists.
""The world's hidden heritage contains clues to humankind's collective resilience and creativity,"" Dr Parcak explained. ""It's up to all of us to protect this heritage, and with GlobalXplorer, we are empowering a 21st Century army of global explorers to discover and protect our shared history.""
Users of the site will be given a tutorial showing them what different patterns on images mean. When six people flag an area of potential interest, it will be handed over to Dr Parcak's team to assess whether it is an area worthy of exploration.
The website will also allow citizen archaeologists to spot potential looting of existing sites, which is becoming a huge problem in sites around the world.
And to make sure looters do not use the site to locate potential targets, the high-resolution satellite images are broken into tens of million of small tiles which are displayed to users in a random order without the ability to navigate or pan out. The tiles do not contain any location reference or co-ordinate information.
Users are rewarded for their time with content about Peru, behind-the-scenes looks at archaeological sites and the opportunity to join archaeologists on digs.
DigitalGlobe, a satellite imagery company, is providing more than 200,000 sq km of satellite imagery of Peru for users to peruse.
There are plans to launch the site in other countries later this year.

180,"The Report on Jobs: Scotland also found that salary growth is slowing and the country's economy is ""under-performing"" relative to the UK as a whole.
Kevin Green, the chief executive of the body behind the report, said the Brexit result had brought uncertainty.
It was one of a series of factors affecting business confidence, he said.
The report concluded that December saw the steepest decrease in the number of people placed in permanent jobs by Scottish recruitment consultancies for more than seven years.
Following recent ""marginal"" decreases, the rate of decline picked up to the fastest seen since June 2009, the study noted.
That contrasted with further - albeit slightly slower - growth in permanent placements across the UK.
The report was commissioned by the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) and compiled by Markit.
Analysts surveyed about 100 recruitment and employment consultants across Scotland for the latest monthly study.
They found that there was also a sharp slowdown in growth of permanent salaries, which rose at the weakest rate seen in almost four years. Again, that put Scotland behind the UK average, experts said.
Recruiters further recorded a marked drop in the availability of candidates for permanent jobs last month, the sharpest fall since August.
They also spotted a fractional reduction in the availability of candidates for temporary jobs, ending a six-month run of improvement.
On a brighter note, the report pointed to a strong rise in hourly rates of pay for temporary staff.
Wage inflation in the temporary jobs market was found to be the fastest since May, matching the trend seen at the UK level.
Mr Green, of REC, said: ""The jobs market in Scotland is going through a tough patch, with fewer people securing permanent jobs each month and salary growth slowing down.
""Scotland's economy is under-performing relative to the UK, the energy sector has weakened and the referendum result has brought uncertainty.
""These factors are all having a significant impact on business confidence.
""Employers are continuing to post vacancies in Scotland, which suggest that demand for staff is strong, but employers are showing hesitancy when it comes to making hiring decisions.
""It's possible that the jobs market will pick up again quickly if confidence is shored up.
""The government can help this by providing clarity on their priorities for the EU negotiations and the likely impact on employers.""","The Scottish jobs market is going through a ""tough patch"", with fewer people securing permanent positions, according to a new report.",38558632

The route, which includes castles, towns, villages and Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park, attracted more than 60,000 people in 2015.
Muir left Scotland for America aged 11 and became one of the most influential figures in the history of the environmental movement.

183,"Data from the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) showed independent schools appealed 6% of results in 2015.
That compared with 2.1% for council-run secondaries.
The Scottish government said ""no young person is at a disadvantage through the results service in Scotland"".
Labour said appeal fees should be scrapped in order to ""level the playing field for every pupil"".
It is concerned that fees of up to Â£39.75 for appeals could deter some local authority schools from applying.
The new appeal rate figures were revealed in evidence from the SQA to MSPs on Holyrood's Education Committee,
Fees were introduced by the SQA in 2014 to help deter schools from putting in purely speculative appeals.
In 2013 local authority schools submitted 62,486 appeals, but the following year the total dropped to 7,056 before rising again in 2015 to 9,584.
Labour education spokesman Iain Gray said it seemed SNP ministers ""could not care less about this unfairness in the system"".
He said: ""They talk the talk on equity, so they should back a fair education system by committing to scrap these unfair fees, and level the playing field for every pupil.""
With the 2016 exam results published last week week, Mr Gray said: ""Pupils across Scotland will be considering this weekend whether to appeal grades they received on Tuesday.
""An exam appeal decision can be the deciding factor between a pupil getting to college or university, with all the opportunities that may bring. Money shouldn't come into it.
""The figures clearly show that the SNP's introduction of exam appeal fees has put pupils from state schools at a disadvantage compared to those educated privately.
""That is just not fair.""
A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""No young person is at a disadvantage through the results service in Scotland. Only schools and colleges can make requests to SQA's results services.
""Whether the pupil is from a local authority or independent school, a review can only be requested if the school has a legitimate query about a candidate's results.
""As with all SQA charges, local authorities meet the costs of requests by public sector schools to use this service.

185,"The 38th (Welsh) Division paved the way for control of the woodland - nearly a mile wide and more than a mile deep - in northern France. Its capture was of key importance in the Battle of the Somme where Allied forces would fight the Germans on a 15-mile front for five months.
During a bloody five-day battle  3,993 Welsh soldiers were killed, missing or injured, putting their division out of action for almost a year.
In the first of two written documentaries, Lieutenant-General Jonathon Riley, late of the Royal Welch Fusiliers, describes the events leading up to and during the battle, recorded in such depth thanks to the literary tradition of his former regiment.
Lieutenant General Riley is a former Commander British Forces Iraq and Deputy Commander NATO forces in Afghanistan; now Visiting Professor in War Studies at King's College London and Chairman of the Royal Welch Fusiliers Regimental Trust. Editor of Llewelyn Wyn Griffith's memoir Up to Mametz - and Beyond and author of 17 other books.
Between 2001 and 2015, the British Armed Forces lost 454 men and women in Afghanistan.
We lost that number on one morning, 7 July 1916, before the attack by the 38th (Welsh) Division had even reached the edge of its objective, Mametz Wood on the Somme battlefield.
The 38th Division had been raised in late 1914 as part of Kitchener's New Army - an army for the long war that he was the first to recognise.
Formations like it were being raised all over the country but Wales more than played its part in fielding the huge new army.
In spite of the paucity of population in Wales, The Royal Welch Fusiliers, for example, raised the fourth highest number of battalions - a total of 45 - of all regiments on the Army List during the war, beaten only by those with large urban populations: Greater London and Middlesex, Durham and Manchester.
David Lloyd George was active in the campaign to expand the army in Wales, espousing even a Welsh Army Corps.
This particular initiative came to nothing.
In part, even allowing for the herculean effort of raising the numbers of troops that it did, Wales could not support a corps of perhaps 40,000 men for several years - especially as the high command of the army would not extract the regular Welsh infantry and cavalry units from their parent formations to provide the backbone of a new corps.
Politically, too, a Welsh Army Corps would have opened the door for similar formations in Scotland and Ireland.
An army corps is a powerful instrument in the formation of new nations, as those of Australia, New Zealand and Canada showed and at this time, just before the war, the great political issue of the moment had been Irish home rule.
This had been shelved for the duration, by mutual consent, and no one in London would support any move that would bring it back to prominence while the bigger matter of war with Germany demanded their full attention.
The division's first eight months were spent in training in north Wales, at Winchester and on Salisbury Plain.
Much of this seems to have been very basic stuff: close order drill, route marches and PT to get the men fit, equipment husbandry, weapon training, minor tactics and courses for specialists like signallers, medics, Lewis and Vickers gunners.
One reason we know so much about the Battle of Mametz lies in the literary tradition of The Royal Welch Fusiliers.
Serving at Mametz, at various times, were Siegfried Sassoon, Robert Graves, James Dunn, Frank Richards, Llewellyn Wyn Griffith, David Jones, Bill Tucker, Harold Gladstone Lewis, and Wynn Powell Wheldon.
These are significant figures in the artistic landscape of the Great War.
The fighting strength of the 38th Welsh Division which, including its combat support and administrative units, stood at about 18,500 men, lay chiefly in its three infantry brigades: 113, 114 and 115 Brigades.
Each of these were composed of four or five battalions drawn from the Welsh Regiments: The Royal Welch Fusiliers, which recruited all over Wales as well as in London and Birmingham; the South Wales Borders, which recruited in south-east Wales and the English border county of Monmouthshire; and the Welch Regiment, drawn from south and west Wales.
However, there was scarcely anyone with military experience in these battalions, save for the few regular officers and NCOs drafted in to form and train them.
Officers in the Service divisions, like 38th, were selected therefore not on any basis of military efficiency but on the basis of patronage - often in the gift of Lloyd George himself.
In the 15th (London Welsh) Battalion of The Royal Welch Fusiliers, Noel Evans, for example, came from a noted Merionethshire family.
He was later deputy director of public prosecutions, a JP, high sheriff and deputy lord lieutenant of the county; Goronwy Owen was related to Lloyd George by marriage.
He had a very good war, ending as a Lieutenant-Colonel with a DSO and was later Liberal MP for Caernarvonshire and president of British Controlled Oilfields.
Llewelyn Wyn Griffith owed his commission at least in part to the patronage of the Liberal MP Ellis Griffith.
After its months of basic training, the 38th Division was in late November 1915 reviewed by Queen Mary.
One of its brigades, 113 (Royal Welch) Brigade, also received a new commander, Brigadier-General Llewellyn Alberic Emilius Price-Davies, who replaced Brigadier-General Owen Thomas - a man who had done more than anyone else to to invigorate recruiting in Wales - in controversial circumstances; although later knighted, Owen Thomas lost all three of his sons killed during the war.
Llewelyn Wyn Griffith described Price-Davies as the second most stupid soldier he ever met.
Price-Davies had done well in the small wars which preceded 1914 and had won a VC and a DSO in South Africa. He was, said Wyn Griffith, too dull to be frightened.
His recently published letters fail to give us a kinder view of him.
Known as 'Jane' by his fellow regulars, he exemplified the thoughtless brutality that is many people's stereotype of the Great War general officer - unimaginative, slow, fascinated by the minor trivia of latrine buckets and polished brass.
He was one of those who had to be promoted to fill command appointments in a rapidly expanding army, promoted on the basis that bravery in combat signifies the ability to exercise high command - but for whom the demands of modern war were all too much.
Under Price-Davies, the brigade embarked for service in France on 1 December 1915 in pouring rain.
Not long after its arrival, the division was doing duty in trenches at Laventie, where some of its units took part in the little-known second Christmas Truce - that again is another story.
From January until June 1916 the battalions and brigades took their turn at the drudgery of trenches, learning their trade and being slowly transformed from a bunch of amateurs into something approaching units capable of simple tasks.
These tours of trenches were not, as many people think, affairs lasting months.
In the desperate days of late 1914 and early 1915 there were recorded instances of units holding the line for weeks at a time but by the spring of 1915, most divisions operated a rotation in which each brigade spent a few days in the front line; then a few days in the support line, then days in reserve - these were often the worst period as the men would spend all night on duties like carrying supplies up to the line, or sand-bagging and wiring and other heavy work.
This would be followed by a rest period and training, before the rotation began again.
In spite of all this, the 38th Division could not be described as capable of taking part in a major combined-arms operation against fortified German positions in mid 1916 - which was the task they would be given at Mametz.
And so we come to the summer of 1916.
Allied war strategy for the year had been formulated during a major conference at Chantilly in December 1915, where it was agreed that major, simultaneous offensives would be launched by the Russians, the Italians in the Alps, and the British and French in the West - thus assailing the Central Powers around the whole perimeter of the war.
Shortly after the conference, General Sir Douglas Haig replaced Sir John French as Commander-in-Chief of the British Expeditionary Force.
Haig favoured an attack in Flanders, which was easily served by the line of communication through the Channel Ports and which, if it went well, might even drive the Germans away from the Belgian coast from where their submarines were decimating British shipping.
However, rather as we were with the Americans in Iraq and Afghanistan, the British in 1916 were the junior partners in a coalition with the French and in February 1916, General Joseph Joffre, the French C-in-C, insisted on a joint British and French attack astride the River Somme in Picardy, beginning in August.
Shortly afterwards, the Germans launched their attack around Verdun.
The French threw all they had into preventing a German breakthrough here, which if it succeeded would open a major avenue of advance towards Paris.
Their commitment to the Somme battle was thus significantly reduced and the bulk of the burden shifted to the British and Imperial troops. Twenty divisions were now committed as against only 13 French divisions.
Moreover as the mincing machine of Verdun developed, the aim of the Somme offensive changed from being part of a decisive allied blow against Germany, to one of relieving the pressure on the French; the date of the attack was brought forward from August to July.
Among senior British commanders there was disagreement on how the required effect would be achieved.
'Bite-and-hold'
General Sir Henry Rawlinson, whose Fourth Army would conduct the attack, favoured a 'bite-and-hold' approach, which would concentrate resources and which recognised the British inability to exploit a breakthrough even if one were made.
Haig's concept, by contrast, was for a more general attack on a wider front.
Much emphasis was based on the ability of allied artillery to destroy German wire and fortifications and allow the infantry first to break in to the German defences, and then break through.
In reality, British field artillery was still woefully behind that of the Germans.
Most of it was of light or medium calibres - without therefore the weight of shell needed to cut up barbed wire or demolish deep dugouts - nor had the huge strides in fuse technology that appeared in late 1917 yet emerged, which would allow artillery to do these things with devastating effect.
Finally, without battlefield radio, artillery was still controlled on pre-arranged timings.
This meant that the infantry had to keep up with the artillery fire as it shifted, rather than the artillery being manoeuvred to support the infantry.
If the infantry was held up, the barrage would move on, leaving them exposed.
Air support too was in its infancy and could do little other than deliver machine gun fire or small bombs, or direct artillery by observing the fall of shot and sending correction messages.
Rawlinson was, too, well aware of the quality of the infantry with which he had to make this assault.
After the losses among the regular and reserve forces during 1914 and 1915, the bulk of the British Expeditionary Force was made up of the volunteers who had joined Kitchener's New Army.
Kitchener had formed this army with the intention of having it ready for major operations in 1917: yet now, strategic considerations over-ruled their lack of expertise and these units and formations were to be required to undertake a difficult operation, without enough experience, a year earlier than had been intended, and without the compensation of effective fire support.
This is not to say that preparations were not extensive and as thorough as they could be in a relatively short time.
In fact they were the most extensive that had yet been undertaken in the entire history of the British Army in war.
Millions of shells and tons of other stores of all kinds - food, water, medical equipment, barbed wire, small arms ammunition, spare clothing and weapons - were accumulated behind the front, all very difficult to conceal from German air reconnaissance. Many miles of standard and narrow gauge railway and tramway were laid.
All roads were improved and new causeways laid over marshy ground.
Water for men and horses
Additional dugouts to shelter troops were built by the Labour Corps; magazines and dumps were built, dressing stations and field hospitals erected and staffed.
Gun emplacements and miles of communication trenches were dug.
Telephone cables were laid and mining operations undertaken beneath the German lines.
In most places, water for men and horses was a serious problem so that many wells and boreholes had to be sunk, and more than 100 pumping stations built.
All this is sometimes overlooked in the general recriminations about the level of casualties during the battle.
With the benefit of hindsight it is not surprising that except for the area around Montaubin, the objectives of 1 July 1916 were not gained.
Why not surprising then, in spite of all the preparations?
First, because - as we mentioned earlier - the majority of the artillery used in the bombardment that preceded the battle was of light calibres - 15 and 18-pounders and trench mortars.
Although there were 1,500 guns firing in support of the attack, and they fired 1.6 million rounds, only one-third of those were medium or heavy calibres.
The weight of shell was not enough to break up deep German dugouts, nor the extensive belts of German barbed wire - in many places, between 100 and 200 metres thick.
Nor were the fuses then in use sensitive enough to be detonated by a slight brush with the wire.
In many places, assaulting troops came up against unbroken wire covered by German machine-gun fire, which stopped them; and then artillery fire that killed them.
The German artillery, not the machine gun, was the big killer on the post-1915 battlefields of the Great War.
Secondly, because as so often until 1918, there were some places where penetrations were made.
All too often, in such cases, the assaulting troops broke in, but could not break through because of the way that the Germans organised their defence in depth, had massive artillery support on call, and always, always, counter-attacked immediately.
Some witnesses recalled the German signal rockets going up for fire on their defensive tasks, looking ""like a line of poplar trees"".
But there was some success around Montauban.
The 7th and 21st Divisions broke into the German lines at Fricourt and captured Mametz village.
Taking part in that attack was the 1st Battalion R.W. Fusiliers, Siegfried Sassoon among them, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel C.I. Stockwell, ('Buffalo Bill') a participant in the famous Christmas Truce of 1914.
At 06.45 in the morning, the bombardment rose to a crescendo. At 07.25, mines were fired under the German lines.
At first, the German resistance was strong and the assaults by two other battalions were stopped and a second attack in the afternoon, not properly co-ordinated, was also stopped with the loss of half the attacking troops.
At 16.00, 1st Royal Welch Fusiliers was ordered to capture the high ground to the east of Fricourt. 1 R.W. Fus, and indeed the rest of 20 Infantry Brigade to which it belonged, had been specially organised and trained by Stockwell and their brigade commander, another R.W. Fusilier, John Minshull-Ford (known as 'Scatter').
Using techniques later adopted by the whole army, the battalion infiltrated using shell-holes and portions of captured German trenches, leading with bombing parties supported by other parties carrying ammunition - giving rise to the expression ""bombing along"".
By dark - about 22.30, Sunken Road trench had been consolidated and several hundred prisoners taken, for the loss of only four men killed and 35 wounded: not at all the usual story of 1 July 1916.
That evening, Haig decided to reinforce what success he had, and attack again around Fricourt in order to capture the German second defence line at its closest point between Longeval and Bazentin.
Rawlinson had little option but to assault this position, which was a low but commanding ridge, frontally.
He decided to do so between the two large woods of Mametz on the left and Trones on the right.
The assault would be phased in order to provide the maximum possible weight of artillery fire in support of the assaulting troops.
Mametz would be taken first, to secure the flank against the inevitable German counter-attack.",On the eve of the 100th anniversary of the battle of Mametz Wood - the first major offensive of World War One for many Welsh soldiers - memorial services are being planned across the country.,36667730

188,"""Any video or site just pops up... they're very excited about the speed,"" Somalia Wireless's Liban Egal says.
Until now access to the internet has been via dial-up or satellite links.
Earlier this year, 3G mobile phone services were cut off because of a threat from Islamist militants.
Connecting Mogadishu to the world
The al-Qaeda-linked al-Shabab group issued a directive in January ordering all internet services to be stopped, saying those who did not comply would be seen as ""working with the enemy"" and dealt with according to Islamic law.
Al-Shabab was driven out of the capital, Mogadishu, in August 2011, but still controls many smaller towns and rural areas in the south and centre of the country where they have imposed a strict version of Sharia.
Following their threat, 3G networks nationwide were turned off but the project to launch fibre optic cable services continued in the capital, the BBC's Moalimu Mohammed reports from Mogadishu.
He says the fibre optic connections, which have been rolled out over the last week by several internet providers, are only available in Mogadishu.
People have been flocking to hotels and internet cafes to try out the fast service - some seeing video platforms like YouTube and social networking sites for the first time, our correspondent says.
Mr Egal said the difference in speed was like the difference between ""day and night"".
For those residents who have recently returned from the diaspora the development was a relief, he said.
It was ""almost a culture shock"" for those who have never left Somalia, he added.
He said the move would be a huge boost for the country, which is recovering from more than two decades of civil war.
""Every time a fibre optic cable is connected to a country they see their GDP [gross domestic product] going up because their communication costs go down,"" Mr Egal said.
""All life will be affected - businesses, the government, universities - they all will see the benefits.""
Our reporter says the current security situation will limit the rollout of fibre optic services to the rest of the country.

But there is still a (OK, pretty small) chance you'll be going.
So if you haven't got a ticket yet, here's Newsbeat's guide to trying to blag your way into Worthy Farm in Somerset.
A lot can change in nine months and there will be always be people who can no longer make it.
Fingers crossed, a fair number of these people will give their tickets back to organisers - these will then go back into a bank of available tickets.
So your best chance is being poised to pounce on the resale pot in early 2015.
Some organisations, such as Oxfam, offer tickets - in return for your time.
Volunteers are always needed at the festival to act as stewards, doing things like watching entrances and exits.
In return for your ticket you're usually required to work several shifts over the course of the weekend.
You have to pay a deposit upfront for the ticket but that's reimbursed at the end providing you've done your job and not ended up partying day and night in Shangri La.
Some tickets are kept specifically for people who live in and around Pilton, the village where Glastonbury closest to Worthy Farm.
This keeps the local community happy as tens of of thousands of people descend on them and their local services for a week in June.
Day tickets for the Sunday are available exclusively for residents in Somerset whose day-to-day lives are most likely to be affected by the festival.
In addition, a limited amount of full tickets are available for people who live in parishes in central Somerset.
Those tickets are available from next year and the usual registration system applies.
If you make the best beetroot smoothies in the country, can knock up an artisan wood-fired pizza or simply make a great burger, you can apply to trade at Glastonbury.
It'll cost you money and you'd be tied up with serving huge lines of hungry festival-goers.
However, through the haze of noodle steam food you might be able to grab a bit of music.
Traders can apply to work at Glastonbury from 13 October.
You could always get some mates together and create an incredible debut album.
A place on the Radio 1 or 1Xtra playlist would beckon.
Alex Turner from Arctic Monkeys or Tom Meighan from Kasabian could become your biggest fan.
You may even nab a Brit Award.
By that point, Glastonbury organisers would have no choice but to put you on the bill. As emergency headliner. Good luck.

After its 2011 bailout, Portugal saw austerity policies under a centre-right government until elections in 2015.
Since then, a Socialist-led coalition has reversed those austerity measures.
EU economy commissioner Pierre Moscovici said the outcome was ""extremely good news"" for Portugal.
The Portuguese finance ministry hailed the Commission's decision, calling it a ""turning point"".
""It expresses the evaluation of the Commission that Portugal's excessive budget deficit has been corrected in a sustainable and lasting way,"" the ministry said in a statement.
""Confidence in the Portuguese economy is beginning to be reflected by international institutions.""
Under EU rules, member states are not supposed to run annual deficits greater than 3% of their total economic output.
Portugal now complies with those rules, but some other member states are less fortunate.
On Monday, the Commission, which has the power to oversee eurozone countries' draft budgets, said France and Spain were still subject to the disciplinary procedure.

193,"The two are embroiled in a long-running dispute over the role of guards, with talks due to begin on Wednesday.
Parent firm Govia Thameslink (GTR) asked Acas to mediate in an attempt to avert what the firm said was ""damaging"" and ""unnecessary"" strike action.
It has set a deadline of Thursday to avoid the strike schedule.
Southern services have been beset by delays and cancellations for weeks due to the dispute and staff shortages, which the company has blamed on high levels of sickness.
The RMT has offered to suspend the week-long strike - due to begin on Monday - if Southern puts its plans for guards on hold.
The plans involve new trains where the driver operates the doors using CCTV but the RMT fears job losses and has safety concerns.
It said the safety of the travelling public on ""dangerously overcrowded trains and platforms"" was ""the fundamental issue at the heart of this dispute"".
If the strike goes ahead, Southern said it would run a restricted service. Many routes would have fewer trains and some routes would have none at all.
However, it said with the use of ""contingency"" conductors it would run almost 60% of its normal timetable.
GTR passenger service director Angie Doll said: ""We are sorry that our passengers once again look set to suffer further disruption because of the RMT.""
She said the action was unnecessary as the plans would cost no-one their jobs and would free up staff on board trains to better serve passengers.
She also claimed the changes would lead to fewer cancellations in future.
""The new on-board supervisor will be able to go anywhere on our network, significantly reducing the perennial problem of train cancellations due to conductors not being available when they're delayed by disruption, for example,"" she said.
At an evening rally in Brighton, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called for an end to Southern's franchise and repeated his party's commitment to return railways to public ownership.
He said: ""They should have said, 'if you cut the services, we'll cut you out'. But that would take a government that stood up for people.
""What is the point of a franchise agreement â€¦ if a company can walk away from their commitments at no cost?""
When the strike dates were announced, rail minister Paul Maynard said RMT bosses were overlooking their impact on the travelling public and claimed GTR's changes would modernise services and be better for passengers .","Southern has promised to run 60% of its normal timetable if a five-day strike by the Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers union (RMT) goes ahead.",36957375

The cathedral said it had scientific evidence to back up its claim.
Lincoln Cathedral said it was ""interested"" in the research.
The circular map is 52in (132cm) in diameter and shows a medieval view of the world with Jerusalem at the centre.
The map, which has been dated to about 1300, features the name of its author Richard of Haldingham or Lafford - believed to be the town of Sleaford, in Lincolnshire.
However, the cathedral's education officer Sarah Arrowsmith, who has studied the map for 10 years and has written a book on the subject, said she believed Richard died before the creation of the map.
She said tests on the wood in the triptych on which the map was displayed showed it had been grown in the Herefordshire area, while a compass hole in the centre of the map corresponds with a hole on the wood.
""It makes it look as if the map was made in situ,"" she said. ""All the dates add up to suggest there is more evidence it was made in Hereford than Lincoln.
""It may be that there was a map in Lincoln that inspired ours - or it was a copy of an exemplar of some sort - but that's just speculation.""
Jackie Croft, chapter clerk and administrator at Lincoln Cathedral, said: ""We are always interested to hear about any research being done on Mappa Mundi and its origins, as we are aware from conversations with Hereford Cathedral that there is a Lincolnshire connection.

196,"Sir Edward is one of a number of prominent names being looked at by detectives from Operation Midland.
Separately, the police watchdog is investigating whether Wiltshire Police failed to pursue claims in the 1990s.
The force said it had already received calls after an appeal for information.
Sir Edward died at his home in Salisbury in 2005 aged 89.
The development comes after the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said it would look at whether Wiltshire officers failed to pursue allegations of child abuse made against the former prime minister.
A retired detective has alleged that claims were made in the 1990s but not followed up.
The IPCC will also look at whether a criminal prosecution was dropped when a person ""threatened to expose that Sir Edward Heath may have been involved in offences concerning children"".
Wiltshire Police and the NSPCC said they had received ""a number of calls"" from members of the public after asking for information.
They said any lines of enquiry would be passed to the relevant police force and followed up.
Labour MP Tom Watson said he had referred two allegations of child sexual abuse by Sir Edward to the police since 2012.
He said: ""I passed them both to the police, who have confirmed to me that at least one of those allegations is being investigated and taken seriously.""
He said the different approach to allegations by different forces showed the need for a national police inquiry.
Operation Midland is examining claims that boys were abused by a group of powerful men from politics, the military and law enforcement agencies at locations across southern England and in London in the 1970s and 1980s.
It has focused on the Dolphin Square estate in Pimlico, south-west London.
Friends of Sir Edward have dismissed the claims saying there is not a shred of evidence to link him to abuse.
The Sir Edward Heath Charitable Foundation, which operates the museum at Arundells, his home in Salisbury, said it welcomed the investigation.
""We wholeheartedly believe [it] will clear Sir Edward's name and we will co-operate fully with the police in their enquiries,"" a spokesman said.
Sir Edward led the 1970-1974 Conservative government and took Britain into what was then the European Economic Community.
He lost his leadership of the party to Margaret Thatcher in 1975 - something he never forgave her for and he refused to serve in her cabinet.

But a research project creating a 5m-long (16ft) tapestry illustrating the town's 900-year-old links has raised more than Â£431,000 to renovate it.
Pam Hunt, project leader, said it was a ""fascinating story"".
The Talking Tapestry of Langum (one of Llangwm's historical names) - which has a downloadable smart phone app to tell the story of the village's ties - forms part of the Heritage Llangwm project.
As part of the project some of the village's men had their DNA tested and found a direct link to the Flemish founders.
Norman Roach, 82 had his DNA tested and was ""astounded"" to discover he was directly related to the 12th Century settlers.

On the east coast, 1,400 properties flooded and 18,000 people evacuated.
Joe Noake of the Environment Agency said: ""We are continually reviewing how we respond to such incidents.""
The tidal surge saw ""exceptionally high levels"" not experienced for at least 60 years and the agency's defences and warning systems helped ""reduce the impact significantly"", he added.
The recommendation was one of eight in the report, accepted by the council's cabinet.
In the East Riding, 300 properties (69 commercial and 231 residential) were directly affected by flooding and an estimated 6,000 acres (2,400 hectares) of agricultural land flooded, it said.
The estimated damage was less than 1% of what it could have been without flood defences, the report said.
The water level at the Hull tidal barrier reached a record level during the surge - just 16ins (40cm) below the top.
The report also recommends property owners in the affected areas should develop a personal flood plan.
During the surge, there was significant flooding at various locations including Bridlington, Skipsea, Hornsea, Tunstall, Easington, Kilnsea, Paull, Hessle, North Ferriby, Faxfleet, Blacktoft, Yokefleet, Saltmarshe, Skelton, Old Goole and Reedness.
Hull city centre was also flooded.
Mr Noake said the Environment Agency had undertaken ""significant works"" to many flood defences including Riverside Quay in Hull, Swinefleet and Reedness, Yorkfleet Clough and Kilnsea.

201,"In three separate cases, high profile and influential individuals - a Bollywood star, a powerful politician, and a former business baron - were allowed to walk free by appeals court despite being found guilty by lower courts.
The actor was found guilty of running a vehicle over people sleeping on the street, the politician of amassing unaccounted wealth and the former business baron of corporate fraud.
The wheels of justice grind slowly in India - more than 30 million cases are pending in its courts and more than a quarter of them have been unresolved for at least five years. Snail justice ends up benefitting the rich as witnesses can be intimidated and bought and political pressure and money power can be used to influence and subdue prosecutors and sometimes judges.
It took 13 years for a court in Mumbai to convict actor Salman Khan of culpable homicide and sentence him to five years in prison despite prosecution witnesses turning hostile. But it took two days for an appeals court to suspend the sentence and grant him bail. It helped that Khan had access to some of the best and most expensive lawyers. India has over a million registered lawyers, but a large number of them graduate with dubious degrees from indifferent law schools, are poorly educated and, according to lawyer-turned-journalist Kian Ganz, ""effectively operate as fixers... hawking for work outside small claims courts or as notaries"".
After 18 years, a court last September found former Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayaram Jayalalitha guilty of amassing unaccounted-for-wealth and sentenced her to four years. Some seven months later, on Monday, an appeals court cleared her of corruption charges, saying that the trial court had ""exaggerated"" her wealth.
The case was moved from Tamil Nadu to neighbouring Karnataka to ensure a fair trial, but that doesn't appear to have helped matters. As Supreme Court lawyer Karuna Nundy pointed out, the high court in Karnataka examined the same evidence and said in its 919-page ruling ""repeatedly that the acquittal was a failure of the prosecution"".
It took six years for a court in April to declare B Ramalinga Raju, former head of Satyam Computers, guilty of criminal conspiracy and cheating and sentenced him to seven years in jail. A month later, on Monday, the appeals court accepted a defence plea that he had spent 35 months in jail, a ""substantial part"" of his term, and granted him bail after suspending his sentence.
To be sure, the three rulings really do not mark any sea change and have just happened to come around the same time. It is also true that India's higher courts routinely revoke orders of lower trial courts. For years politicians have evaded corruption charges and the rich and famous have escaped criminal liability through ""high-priced lawyering"".
At the same time, many believe, the recent rulings are - again - an indictment of India's ailing and unfair justice system which is heavily loaded against the poor, and shabby investigation by the police.
Thousands of undertrials languish in Indian prisons for lesser offences unable to afford bail. Judges are also often blamed for being anti-poor. After the Supreme Court granted bail to Jayalalitha last year, Supreme Court lawyer Rajeev Dhavan wrote tellingly about bail discrimination: ""Bail for as many is good, but applying it differentially is not. We do not have clear principles to guide bail decisions - especially in post-conviction cases, where judges look at the crime and behave totally with subjective arbitrariness against the poor.""
The recent rulings reminded me of a highly acclaimed recent indie film called Court - possibly the best Indian film of the year so far - which astutely skewers the country's discriminatory and outdated justice system. A part-time teacher and social activist is hauled to a court on  trumped up charges of instigating a sewage worker to kill himself after listening to one of the activist's incendiary songs. The case grinds on in drab courtrooms with no end in sight, and effectively destroys the activist.
Of course, as Nick Robinson, a fellow at the Harvard Law School's Program on the Legal Profession and at Delhi's Centre for Policy Research, tells me, there are often good judges trying to do the right thing. ""But politics and money is so embedded in the system that it clearly tilts the deck in favour of the powerful,"" he says. ""I also think some judges worry that if they are seen as overly-punitive on those with power, then there might be a backlash against them impacting their careers or the authority of the judiciary.""
India needs more judges, more and better educated lawyers and a thorough repair of what academics Devesh Kapur and Milan Vaishnav call the ""dilapidated and clogged"" plumbing of its courts. Otherwise, as they warn, the judicial process itself will remain the punishment, an enduring shame for the world's biggest democracy.",It's been a bleak seven days for justice in India.,32716847

You asked why people in Stoke-on-Trent called those from Cannock or Hednesford 'yammies'.
And you were curious as to why Rugby radio station was not bombed during World War Two. Here is how we got on with answering your questions.
Norrie Porter, from the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) in Shropshire, said he believed the oldest pub in the county was The Royal Oak, in Cardington, which can trace its history back to the 15th Century.
Mr Porter said there were two pubs which disputed that claim, but The Three Horseshoes, in Alveley, had closed.
And while The Swan Inn, in Aston Munslow, claims to have opened in the 14th Century, English Heritage believes the building is 16th Century.
He said the pub in the oldest building was probably The Old Eagles, in Whitchurch, which was built in the 14th Century but has only been a pub since 1868.
And he explained this was further confused because pubs were only really licensed after the 1751 Gin Act and before then any house could claim to be a beer house.
It is generally thought that people from Cannock and the surrounding areas are called 'yammies' due to their use of the term 'yam' to mean 'you are'.
For example, ""yam orite, yam"" means ""you're alright, you are.""
Yam Yam or yammie is more often used as a term for people from Wolverhampton, Walsall and Dudley, but if anyone's using it about those from Cannock or Hednesford, that's why.

He thinks the Germans were using the station as a radio, or physical navigational beacon, possibly to help them find Coventry and Birmingham.

Lufthansa has not decided how much the service will cost, but it could be linked to the type of ticket purchased.
Broadband is still relatively rare on short-haul flights.
Norwegian is one of the few airlines to offer broadband for free.
Simon Calder from the BBC's Travel Show says that, so far, wifi on planes is ""not very good"" and he does not expect Lufthansa to improve on that.
""It's feasible to provide a broadband connection at 500mph. But if 150 people want to connect then it is likely to be fragile, and not a great experience,"" he said.

According to Deutsche Telekom the combination of satellite technology and a sophisticated ground network will ""deliver the fastest, best and most consistent in-flight broadband experience that meets the needs of airlines in this region"".
Analysis: Jonathan Amos, BBC Science correspondent
There is no doubt there is pent up demand for good wifi in the sky.
But many people who've used the internet onboard an aeroplane may well have a less than favourable view of the experience: low speeds, delays in pages loading, and, significantly, a high cost compared with what can can be purchased in a cafÃ© on the ground.
The new EU-wide system on which Inmarsat and Deutsche Telekom are partnering is designed to tackle all these flaws.
By getting planes to link to ground cell towers should significantly increase speeds - to allow even streaming video in the aircraft seat - while at the same time transforming the cost-per-bit economics of onboard wifi.
But you still need a satellite to fill in any gaps in cell coverage, and to pick up customers' connections when their planes head out of Europe and over the ocean on long-haul flights.
For Inmarsat - even with its current, lower-speed, satellite-only systems - the aero business is now the fastest growing sector in the London company's portfolio.

204,"Emilie, 17, took her life in January and a graphic account of the torment she suffered emerged this week when her diary appeared in a newspaper.
It was immediately followed by a French TV dramatisation of the story of Marion Fraisse, who died three years ago. The France 3 film was poignantly entitled Marion, 13 ans pour toujours - Marion, Forever 13.
The question for France is whether their deaths will help change the way bullying is tackled.
It starts so gradually, you hardly notice it.
In a classroom of rowdy students, Marion is marked out as one of the good girls.
Over the course of the 90-minute drama, she loses her friends, is the victim of rumours, insults and isolation, and then is cornered by a group of boys in the corridor, who grab her, pin her down and throw her shoes away.
""She was asking for it,"" says a passing girl. Marion breaks down and cries. From there the drama follows her descent into desperation, depression, and finally suicide.
The film was adapted from a book by Marion's mother, Nora, who found a letter from the teenager after her death and decided to tell her story.
A poignant act, because one of the most striking elements of that story is how Marion's parents knew about what was happening to their daughter at the time.
Interviewed by a French newspaper to mark the launch of the dramatisation, actress Julie Gayet, who plays Nora, said the film had two points of view: Marion's and her mother's.
The script ""shows that parents never really know their child. Half a child's life escapes them"".
More than four million people tuned in to watch the drama, which was followed by a one-hour debate. Many took to social media afterwards to share their stories and express their anger.
""It's not a suicide, it's murder,"" wrote one Twitter user, called Sara. Another suggested that the film be shown in schools.  Others wrote of their own experiences of bullying, with some saying the experience had haunted them for years after they had left full-time education.

According to official figures, 700,000 pupils are bullied each year in France, and activists say more than 90% of children have access to social networks.
France has tried to improve awareness of bullying in schools, as well as support for the victims.
In 2014, a new anti-bullying law was brought in, and a hotline set up for pupils to report incidents. But activists say France is still not tackling the problem effectively.
""The authorities' response is improving very slowly,"" says psychologist and campaigner Catherine Verdier. ""But France is dragging behind other countries. If you look at Finland, Sweden, where it's a national cause, there was a real impulse from the top to change things.""
""A few schools have improved, but not enough,"" says Willy Pierre who runs 'You Are Heroes', set up after Marion's death to break the taboo around bullying. ""The hotline is only open in school hours, and it can take weeks or months to find a designated adult for the child to talk to face to face.""
The problem has also grown to encompass cyber-bullying and harassment outside the school gates. The solution, he says, is for parents, teachers and pupils to talk openly about the problem.
Emilie was four years older than Marion when she died in January after jumping out of a window at her father's house.
A bright pupil at a private school in the northern city of Lille, Emilie's parents say she endured years of terror up to the age of 13 because she was not considered cool and trendy and loved reading.
Eventually she snapped and they pulled her out of the school. For three years she tried other schools and distance learning, but she developed a phobia of schools and her parents believe her death was linked to depression as a result of the bullying.

Hey, you know what? a boy exclaimed loud enough for everyone in the class to hear but the teacher. Apparently they're going to award a prize to the ugliest clever-clogs in every country. Oh yeah? his neighbour tittered. I bet you we've got the winner in the class

A report by Unicef two years ago found that bullying was a worldwide problem that ""exists at some level and in some form in every country"".
Children who are bullied, it says, are prone to a vast range of negative effects ""including depression, anxiety, thoughts of suicide"".
One mother told a French newspaper that her daughter's school had responded to the problem of bullying with ""a conspiracy of silence"".
But after days of debate about the sad lives of two French teenagers, those taboos may finally be crumbling.

205,"He was accompanied by Omani companions Mohammed Zadjali and Amer Al-Wahaibi.
The trio arrived on Wednesday in Doha, Qatar, after a 49-day trek on foot and by camel across 1,200 kilometres of Arabian desert known as the Rub' Al-Khali, meaning ""The Empty Quarter"".
They are the first people to complete this coast-to-coast journey, from Salalah in Oman to Doha, in 85 years.
They were following the route of an earlier British explorer, Bertram Thomas.
Mr Evans, 54, told the BBC the worst part was negotiating 250m-high dunes ""like Alpine peaks"" where their camels sank to their knees in the sand.
In a week that has seen the tragic death of another British explorer, Lt Col Henry Worsley, 55, after crossing Antarctica, this desert journey is a welcome piece of good news.
More than 1,000 well-wishers saw the team off in Salalah when they set out in December, carrying all the food they would need for the seven-week crossing.
Some accompanied the men for the first few kilometres and Evans said they were overwhelmed by hospitality from local tribes people in Oman, Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
""Twenty-eight goats, seven camels and three sheep have been slaughtered in our honour,"" he said.
Snakes and scorpions were frequently sighted and in southern Oman there was plentiful wildlife, which was all protected by law.
But once they crossed into Saudi Arabia, said Evans, there was almost no wildlife to speak of.
Just before halfway through, they reached towering sand dunes that left all three travellers dripping in sweat while the camels bellowed in protest, their knees sinking into the sand, and sometimes refusing to budge.
Throughout their journey their thoughts turned often to Bertram Thomas, who took 60 days to cross the sands with his Bedu guide. When he reached Doha in 1931 telegrams of congratulation poured in, including from King George V.
""Sometimes we went to wells that had been visited by both Bertram Thomas and [legendary British explorer] Sir Wilfred Thesiger,"" Mr Evans said.
The latter, who undertook a similar crossing in the late 1940s but did not reach as far as Doha, wrote in his book Arabian Sands of the extraordinary beauty and solitude of the desert.
He also complained that the discovery of oil had ruined the region.
He once told me that since it was now possible to drive across the desert in a 4x4 vehicle, ""walking across it would be completely pointless"".
That is clearly not a view shared by the trio who completed their crossing today.
""I have just sat in a chair for the first time in 49 days,"" Mr Evans added.

The SNP have selected women in 20 out of 59 seats they are contesting - or 33%. The Lib Dems have 191 female candidates out of 630 - or 30%.
The Conservatives are still compiling their list but currently have 177 women out of 621 candidates - 29%.
A record 191 women were elected in 2015 - around 30% of MPs.
Earlier this year, the election of Tory Trudy Harrison in Copeland took the number of women elected altogether in the past 100 years to 456 - roughly the same as the total number of male MPs in the 2015-2017 Parliament.
General election: What you need to know
Labour's draft election manifesto leaked
MPs recommended in January that political parties should be fined if they failed to ensure at least 45% of their general election candidates were female.
The Women and Equalities Committee said the fact that 30% of current MPs were women represented a ""serious democratic deficit"", for ""no good reason"" and called for a change in the law after the next general election if that figure did not increase ""significantly"".
Both the Conservatives and Lib Dems are fielding a higher proportion of female candidates in the 2017 general election than they had as MPs in the last parliament.
Just over 21% of the Conservative MPs elected in 2015-17 were women.
Conservative MP Maria Miller, who chaired the Women and Equalities Committee in the last Parliament, told the World at One: ""The Conservative Party has made significant progress, particularly under Theresa May and the the work she's done with the Women2Win campaign.""
Mrs May was a founder of the campaign, which aims to increase the representation of women in the party, along with Tory peer Baroness Jenkin.
The SNP is fielding 20 women out of 59 SNP candidates in Scottish seats, or 33.4%. In 2015, the SNP had 36 male MPs and 20 women (35.7%).
The SNP's Kirsty Blackman told the BBC that the surprise timing of the election had meant ""less time to reach out to candidates from non-traditional backgrounds"".

207,"A part of the brain linked to emotions and empathy, called the insula, was found to be particularly small in girls who had suffered trauma.
But in traumatised boys, the insula was larger than usual.
This could explain why girls are more likely than boys to develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the researchers said.
Their findings suggest that boys and girls could display contrasting symptoms after a particularly distressing or frightening event, and should be treated differently as a result.
The research team, from Stanford University School of Medicine, said girls who develop PTSD may actually be suffering from a faster than normal ageing of one part of the insula - an area of the brain which processes feelings and pain.
The insula, or insular cortex, is a diverse and complex area, located deep within the brain which has many connections.
As well as processing emotions, it plays an important role in detecting cues from other parts of the body.
The researchers scanned the brains of 59 children aged nine to 17 for their study, published in Depression and Anxiety.
One group, of 14 girls and 16 boys, had suffered at least one episode of severe stress or trauma while a second group, of 15 girls and 14 boys, had not been exposed to any.
In the group of traumatised boys and girls, there was evidence that one area of the insula - the anterior circular sulcus - had changed in size and volume compared with the group with no trauma.
This shows that the insula is changed by exposure to acute or long-term stress and plays a key role in the development of PTSD, the researchers said.
Lead study author Dr Megan Klabunde said it was important to consider the different physical and emotional reactions to stressful events.
""It is important that people who work with traumatised youth consider the sex differences.
""Our findings suggest it is possible that boys and girls could exhibit different trauma symptoms and that they might benefit from different approaches to treatment.""
And she added: ""There are some studies suggesting that high levels of stress could contribute to early puberty in girls.""
Dr Klabunde said they would now look at other regions of the brain connected to the insula to see if they could detect similar changes.
Post-traumatic stress disorder is the term used to described the psychological effects of being involved in a traumatic event, such as a major car accident, a natural disaster, bullying, abuse or violent crime.
Many young people who experience very distressing events recover without experiencing PTSD - but some people do develop it.
Symptoms can include:
The charity Young Minds says it is normal to experience symptoms for a few weeks after a distressing event but if you are still having symptoms after a month, it is a good idea to talk to your GP who should offer you some therapy to deal with your thoughts and behaviour.","Very stressful events affect the brains of girls and boys in different ways, a Stanford University study suggests.",37936514
208,"Rebel investors had fought for years against forced repurchase of enhanced capital note (ECN) bonds.
But the Supreme Court said the bank had been entitled to buy back the bonds at their original issue price.
The move means investors, who had originally bought bonds issued by mutuals, get lower payouts and lose out on future returns.
A Lloyds Banking Group spokesperson welcomed the decision: ""The Group has sought to balance the interests of all stakeholders including our 2.6 million shareholders, as it takes steps to meet the requirements of the changing regulatory landscape and manage its capital requirements efficiently.""
The bonds had originally been issued as permanent interest-bearing shares (Pibs) by several former building societies that the bank had snapped up over the years, including Halifax and Cheltenham & Gloucester.
They had been very attractive to risk-averse pensioners in particular, with generous annual yields of up to 16%, and the promise of the return of all their capital.
But at the height of Lloyds' cash crisis in 2009 it converted the Pibs to ECN bonds which counted towards Lloyds' capital reserves.
The move helped shore up the bank's capital position at a crucial time as it was able to transfer the £8bn value of the bonds on to its balance sheet.
But, crucially, in the terms and conditions of the ECNs, it said that the bank could buy back the notes at ""par"" - face value - if a so-called ""capital disqualification event"" occurred.
In 2014 Lloyds began offering to buy back the bonds at market value ahead of maturity dates of between 2019 and 2029.
But in December 2014 during a stress test by the Prudential Regulatory Authority the ECNs did not count as capital.
Lloyds subsequently announced that a capital disqualification event had occurred allowing it to buy back the bonds at their original issue price.
Bondholders were angered as the bonds traded at a higher level than their face value, plus they faced losing out on future returns.
They disputed the bank's claims that the bonds had been disqualified as capital and took the case to the High Court.
In 2015 the High Court found in favour of the bondholders with Sir Terence Etherton, the head of the Chancery Division, rejecting Lloyds' argument on the basis that the bonds could still be taken into account in future stress tests.
But the Appeal Court overturned the verdict in the Spring and the Supreme Court has now upheld that decision.
Lloyds began redeeming the bonds after the Appeal Court ruling and remaining bondholders will now get paid the face value of their holdings.
The bank expects to save on interest payments worth £200m each year. The move had originally been aimed at saving five years' interest - £1bn - but the delay in redeeming the notes means that is likely to be reduced to four years.",Lloyds Bank has won a major court battle against bondholders that could save it up to £1bn.,36548645

Means was also a former American Indian Movement (AIM) activist, who helped lead a 1973 uprising at Wounded Knee.
The actor and activist died on Monday at his ranch in Porcupine, South Dakota, a spokeswoman for the Oglala Sioux Tribe said.
Donna Salomon, the tribal spokeswoman, called Means' death a ""great loss"" for the tribe.
In August 2011, Means announced he had inoperable throat cancer and told the Associated Press he was eschewing mainstream medicines in favour of traditional Native American treatments.
The Last of the Mohicans was his first film role and he went on to also appear in films such as Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers.
He also voiced Chief Powhatan in Disney's 1995 animated movie Pocahontas.
Means guest starred in US TV series Curb Your Enthusiasm in 2004.
He also made two albums of protest music with lyrics he wrote - Electric Warrior and The Radical.
The AIM's armed occupation of Wounded Knee in South Dakota - the site of an infamous massacre of Native Americans by US soldiers in the late 19th Century - lasted for 71 days.
The protest followed the failure of AIM followers to impeach the elected tribal president, whom they accused of corruption.
Means ran unsuccessfully for president of his tribe and for the Libertarian nomination for US president in 1988.
But he was also a controversial figure, partly because of the AIM's alleged involvement in the slaying of one of their activists Annie Mae Aquash in 1975.
Authorities believed it was the work of AIM members because they suspected she was an FBI informant.
Paul deMain, a Native American journalist who researched the case, said the AIM's leaders know who ordered Aquash's killing but have covered up the truth for decades.
Means blamed one of his fellow AIM leaders, Vernon Bellecourt, for ordering her killing.

Prof Jay said the inquiry would not hold public hearings into every institution it was investigating, as it would take too long.

The FBI is analysing a strain of ransomware called MSIL/Samas that tries to encrypt data across entire networks rather than single computers.
The plea comes as security firms warn about other novel strains of the fast-growing, data-scrambling cyber-threats.
The FBI sent out the request for help after discovering that the group behind MSIL/Samas had stepped up its efforts to find victims.
In the confidential advisory obtained by Reuters, the FBI said the group used a publicly available security program called Jexboss to scan networks looking for vulnerable versions of the widely used JBoss software.
When a vulnerable system is found, the malware launches an attack that seeks to scramble data on servers. It also finds and deletes the back-up files firms could use to restore data scrambled by ransomware.
Cisco said it had seen a ""widespread campaign"" using Samas targeting firms involved in healthcare. Early versions of the malware charged a ransom of one bitcoin (£300) for every machine hit but later versions upped this to 1.5 bitcoins.
""It is likely the malware author is trying to see how much people will pay for their files,"" wrote Cisco security analyst Nick Biasini in an advisory. ""They even added an option for bulk decryption of 22 bitcoin (£6,600) to decrypt all infected systems.""
The FBI's request for aid comes as security firms warn about recently created ransomware variants that use different methods to lock up systems and force victims to pay.
The Petya malware targets a key Windows system file called the Master Boot Record that helps a PC get started. By overwriting this file, people are prevented from getting at any data on their PC unless they pay up.
Trend Micro said it had seen Petya distributed in email messages crafted to look like they are from someone looking for work. The CV attached to the message is a booby-trapped program that launches Petya, said Trend security engineer Jasen Sumalapao in a blogpost. Petya charges a ransom of 0.9 bitcoins (£265) to unlock infected machines.
Security firm Carbon Black has found another novel strain that goes after many firms that use Windows PowerShell - a scripting program widely used to administer machines running Windows.
Dubbed PowerWare, this strain hides malicious code in Word documents and calls on PowerShell to execute the attack code when the booby-trapped files are opened.
""Deceptively simple in code, 'PowerWare' is a novel approach to ransomware, reflecting a growing trend of malware authors thinking outside the box in delivering ransomware,"" said Rico Valdez from Carbon Black.","The FBI is seeking help from US firms as it investigates a nasty strain of ransomware, Reuters reports.",35916425

220,"Proton Partners International (PPI) received the part that will fire the cancer-treating beam at its Rutherford Cancer Centre.
PPI said the UK's ""most-advanced piece of cancer machinery"" could transform treatment for 500 patients a year.
Currently, only low-energy treatment is available in the UK for rare eye cancers.
The Welsh Government said proton beam therapy will be available at the centre to NHS Wales patients with certain cancers ""within the next year"".
PPI chief executive Mike Moran said it was the ""most strategic health project in this country in decades"".
""It's significant for the people of Wales to have high-energy proton beam therapy available,"" he added.
He said the treatment would ""certainly improve"" clinical outcomes and the experience for patients, who up to now have had to spend up to six weeks abroad to get proton beam therapy.
The use of proton therapy was highlighted by the case of five-year-old Ashya King, whose parents took him to the Czech Republic for treatment for a brain tumour three years ago.
After its installation, the machine will be up and running next year.
PPI said treatment at the centre will be available to medically-insured private patients, self-paying patients and patients referred by the NHS.
Analysis by BBC Wales health correspondent Owain Clarke
This is certainly a coup for those trying to make Wales a hub for health innovation and research.
But it is unclear how many of the 500 patients a year expected to be treated at the privately run centre will be from the Welsh NHS.
That is because the NHS in England is currently building two similar proton beam centres ""in-house"".
Located at established hospitals (in London and Manchester), some argue they'd be better placed to provide more comprehensive, ""wrap-around"" care than would be possible at a stand-alone centre.
Discussions between the company, the Welsh Government and Welsh NHS I'm told are well advanced but whatever the outcome of those, as the first centre of its type in the UK, this is certainly a significant development.
Proton beam therapy is a highly-targeted type of radiotherapy which can treat hard-to-reach cancers, such as spinal tumours, with a lower risk of damaging the surrounding tissue and causing side effects.
About 140 patients a year are sent abroad from across the NHS - mostly to the US and Switzerland - at a cost of around Â£114,000 each.
Experts have said the proton beam clinic in Newport could half that cost, while also allowing patients to remain close to their families while receiving treatment.
The Rutherford Cancer Centre opened in February and receives referrals for conventional cancer treatments.
PPI is building three more proton beam centres in the UK - in Northumberland, Reading and Liverpool.

She said there was ""sensitive material"" inside the laboratories, but it is not yet clear what if anything was destroyed in the fire.
Five people arrested nearby were later released without charge.
Initial reports in Belgian media said a bomb had exploded. But Ms Van Wymersch said that while a bomb was unlikely to have detonated, it was impossible to fully rule out that scenario.
""The location was not chosen randomly,"" she said. ""It's an important site, that includes sensitive documents relating to current investigations.""
""The possibility of a terrorist act is not confirmed. It goes without  saying that several individuals may have wanted to destroy evidence related to  their legal cases,"" Ms Van Wymersch added.
The case was being treated as arson, she said.
Some 30 firefighters helped put out the fire at the National Institute of Criminology, which Ms Van Wymersch said caused damage but caused no casualties.
Forensic analysis linked to criminal cases is carried out at the site, but while it is not the only laboratory of its kind linked to the police, it is the most important forensic test centre in Belgium.
Images submitted to broadcaster RTL by nearby residents showed flames and heavy smoke rising into the night sky.
The independent institute, linked to Belgium's federal justice body, is in Neder-Over-Heembeek, a suburb in the north of Brussels.
Belgium's terror alert level remains high since bomb attacks on Brussels airport and the city's metro, claimed by so-called Islamic State, that killed 32 people in March.","Attackers rammed a car through the gates of a Brussels crime laboratory before starting a fire to destroy forensic evidence, prosecutors say.",37211788
222,"The entry, in the site's chat area, was simplicity itself. Riven Vincent told the site's users - her online friends - that she had asked social services to take her severely disabled daughter into care.
""We get 6 hours respite a week,"" it read. ""They have refused a link family, they have refused extra respite. I cant cope.""
The entry sparked a hugely supportive reaction from the site's users and snowballed into a major front-page story across the national media inside 24 hours.
Riven Vincent, it transpired, had met the prime minister before the election. He had made a private visit to meet her - after an exchange on Mumsnet.
On Thursday his office said he was ""very concerned"". David Cameron was writing to her and was getting in touch with her MP.
The incident is yet another illustration of the power of Mumsnet, or rather the site's 600,000 registered users.
It was co-founded 10 years ago by sports journalist Justine Roberts and TV producer Carrie Longton. Today it has 1.25m unique users every month.
Justine is now the Mumsnet chief executive and last year she hosted the then prime minister Gordon Brown at its 10-year anniversary bash. Mr Brown described it as a ""national institution"".
While Mumsnet has hit the headlines before, most notably in a legal battle with the childcare writer Gina Ford, it is only relatively recently that its members have started flexing their political muscle.
Justine Roberts isn't that surprised by the developments this week. She says interest from politicians started to hot up during the last general election, along with a realisation that social media was an effective way to reach voters.
Both Mr Brown and Mr Cameron did ""live chat"" sessions with Mumsnet, whose members exhibit a marvellous tendency to ""ski off-piste"" with their interrogations.
Mr Brown famously fumbled an answer about his favourite biscuit, while the Conservative leader appeared to stop answering questions for several minutes when his laptop broke.
But Mumsnet does much more than quiz politicians. Funded entirely by advertising, it functions as a resource for information on pregnancy and childcare, offers product reviews and even runs a book club. Tonight it is hosting a chat session with the award-winning author Rose Tremain.
Mumsnet users sometimes have a vexed relationship with the media, and in recent weeks the site took the producers of EastEnders to task over a plotline involving a child abduction.
""All we did was reflect our members' reaction to the storyline,"" explains Ms Roberts. ""These things are often entirely organic, coming directly from our members rather than directed by us as the site's administrators.""
The internet is notoriously capricious, with a site being essential one moment and forgotten the next. But Mumsnet's capacity to hold decision-makers to account shows no sign of fading.
""With Mumsnet,"" says Ms Roberts, ""there's a sense of audience. Facebook is too generalised.
""Riven Vincent's post was shocking, and it caused an immediate reaction. She's known in our community as a caring mother.""
But she admits to being surprised at the size of the story. ""It is extraordinary how quickly these things can mushroom.""",The post was made at lunchtime on Wednesday by a Mumsnet user called Riven.,12238447
223,"A Daily Telegraph investigation says Allardyce, 61, used his role to negotiate a £400,000 deal and also offered advice on how to ""get around"" rules on player transfers.
Allardyce is yet to respond to the allegations and was due to meet with Football Association chairman Greg Clarke and chief executive Martin Glenn on Tuesday.
The former Bolton, Newcastle and West Ham manager also appears to criticise the FA, his international predecessor Roy Hodgson and ex-England assistant Gary Neville.
""You have to let Sam Allardyce defend himself and I just hope he will clear his name,"" said Wenger.
Media playback is not supported on this device
The Telegraph says it will pass transcripts from its investigation to the FA, although they run to ""to many hundreds of pages"" and ""will take some time to collate.""
Allardyce, who has only been in charge for one game and 67 days, was named England boss in July, succeeding Hodgson after a disastrous European Championship campaign.
Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live, former Arsenal and England striker Ian Wright said it would be a ""terrible shame"" for Allardyce to lose his job for ""non-footballing reasons"".
""When you look at Sam and his career, he was never ever going to get the opportunity to manage a top-four club,"" he told BBC Radio 5 live.
""He got the England job and for him to now stand on the brink of losing that job is a crying shame.""
Karren Brady, chief executive of Allardyce's former club West Ham, said she is ""both saddened and disappointed"" by the developments.
""This is a man who spent his whole life trying to get that job, and got it in his 60s. What a great shame if he loses that job through non-footballing reasons,"" she told Radio 1 Newsbeat.
Former FA communications director Julian Eccles has said Allardyce's actions are ""at the very least bad judgement"", and said he will have to justify his claims that third-party ownership is still prevalent.
Media playback is not supported on this device
During the meeting with undercover reporters posing as businessmen, it is alleged Allardyce said it was ""not a problem"" to bypass the rules and he knew of agents who were ""doing it all the time"".
""I think if he is to keep his job at the very least he has to provide the evidence where he says that agents are still involved in this and he has to apologise for stating that these rules are 'ridiculous',"" Eccles told BBC News.
""We cannot have such a senior figure in our game being so disrespectful of such important rules.""
That view was supported by Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker, who tweeted saying Allardyce ""advising on getting around third-party rules"" was the ""biggest problem"".
Third-party ownership of players was banned by the FA in 2008.
It is further alleged by the paper that a deal was struck with the England boss worth £400,000 for him to represent the company to Far East investors and to be a keynote speaker at events.
However, Allardyce told the undercover reporters that any arrangement would have to be cleared by the FA.

224,"The number moving out fell by 10.3% to 22,800 people between July 2013 and June 2014, the NI Statistics and Research Agency (Nisra) revealed.
In the same period, 24,400 people moved to Northern Ireland, meaning an increase in net immigration of 1,600.
During Northern Ireland's economic boom years, annual net immigration peaked at almost 11,000.
Nisra said the number of people leaving Northern Ireland was at its lowest level in five years.
The overall Northern Ireland population was estimated to be 1.84 million in June 2014, an increase of 10,800 on the previous year.
That growth of 0.6% was the highest in the last four years.
That was made up of net immigration plus natural growth of 9,800 (24,200 births compared to 14,300 deaths).
Meanwhile, the number of military personnel in Northern Ireland fell by 600.
The statistics also confirmed a continued ageing population.

225,"In the Daily Telegraph, he said he was ""unlikely"" to join former cabinet colleagues Liam Fox and Owen Paterson in voting to leave in the referendum which he suggested would be in 2016.
Eurosceptic Tory MP Bernard Jenkin said Lord Hague was ""completely wrong"" to suggest a ""Brexit"" could split the UK.
The prime minister has promised to hold an in/out vote before the end of 2017.
Mr Hague's comments came as Poland's new President, Andrzej Duda, warned in an interview with the BBC that the EU would face a ""very serious crisis"" if the UK were to leave.
Mr Duda said the EU had ""many weaknesses"" and warned a UK exit from the bloc could cause further havoc.
""The EU has been shaken time and time again with crises - whether it's the financial crisis, or the refugees crisis,"" he said.
""Let's not pretend, a UK exit from the EU will be a very serious crisis for the EU. Of that I have no doubt.""
In Mr Hague's article he warned that if the UK did vote to leave the EU he believed Scottish nationalists would ""jump at the chance"" to re-open the independence debate, and ""the result of it could well be too close to call"".
He also said a UK departure would see the 28-member bloc lose one of its ""respected military powers"" and leave it weakened.
""To end up destroying the UK and gravely weakening the European Union would not be a very clever day's work,"" he wrote.
""So, even as a long-standing critic of so much of that struggling organisation, I am unlikely in 2016 to vote to leave it,"" he said.
""We will have to ask, disliking so many aspects of it as we do, whether we really want to weaken it, and at the same time increase the chances, if the UK left the EU, of Scotland leaving the UK.""
When he was Conservative leader, William Hague fought the 2001 election campaign on a strong commitment to keep the pound, and keep out of the euro.
He has been seen as a Eurosceptic ever since.
But Lord Hague says a vote to withdraw would give the SNP the pretext to call second referendum on independence.
Those who want to leave the EU are likely to see this as a tacit admission that Prime Minister David Cameron's negotiations will produce little of substance and that alternative arguments are already being marshalled for continued UK membership.
Responding to Lord Hague's comments, Mr Jenkin said Downing Street was ""clearly mounting a campaign to stay in the EU"" even though Mr Cameron's renegotiations are not yet complete.
He added: ""It is extremely unlikely that if England, Wales and Northern Ireland voted clearly to leave the European Union, that Scotland would vote differently.""
He told BBC Radio 4's The World at One that Mr Hague's view ""was not a surprise"" and urged the prime minister not to ""muzzle"" ministers in expressing their views on a decision that ""utterly dwarfs"" the significance of a general election.
SNP Europe spokesman Stephen Gethins said the Conservatives had ""lost all credibility on Europe"".
""While it is welcome progress to see senior Tories finally ceding that it would be completely unacceptable for Scotland to be dragged out of the European Union against its will - we still have no answers as to how they will ensure this does not happen,"" he added.
On Monday former Deputy Prime Minister Lord Heseltine warned of a ""civil war"" in the Conservative Party if cabinet ministers were given a free vote in the EU referendum - meaning they could vote as they saw fit and were not whipped into toeing the party line.
He argued that a free vote would make Mr Cameron a global ""laughing stock"".
Meanwhile, Conservative Party vice-chairman Mark Field has also criticised calls for ministers to be given a free vote.
He told the Daily Telegraph that anyone who was not prepared to back Mr Cameron's re-negotiation should resign from the government.","Leaving the EU could lead to the break up of the UK, former Foreign Secretary William Hague has warned.",35165720

A DUP elected representative since 1981, Mr Hay played a key role in resolving parading tensions in Londonderry.

228,"Detlev Guenzel, 56, strangled and dismembered the 59-year-old at a small bed-and-breakfast run by Mr Guenzel in eastern Germany in 2013.
Guenzel was sentenced to eight-and-a-half years in jail.
Prosecutors could not confirm that he had actually eaten the victim, but some body parts were never found.
Lawyers representing the family of the murdered man - 59-year-old Polish-born Wojciech Stempniewicz - sought a 15-year sentence for Guenzel, the father of three adult children described by neighbours as affable, warm hearted and courteous.
Guenzel went on trial in August for killing Stempniewicz at his home, a bed-and-breakfast inn in the town of Hartmannsdorf-Reichenau in the Erz mountains near the border with the Czech Republic.
He was accused of cutting the body into small pieces and burying them in his garden, making a macabre home video in the process.
The pair met in October 2013 on a website for slaughter and cannibalism fantasies which described itself as the ""#1 site for exotic meat"" with more than 3,000 registered members, correspondents say.
Guenzel, who had served in the police for 30 years, retracted a confession he initially made to detectives soon after Stempniewicz's killing in which he said that he had cut his throat.
The defence argued that Stempniewicz had a death wish and had already hanged himself in Guenzel's cellar ""S&M studio"" before he took a knife, then an electric saw, to the gagged-and-bound man.
Investigators have been unable to determine the cause of death definitively because of the poor condition of the corpse.
They have, however, been able to ascertain that the pair had extensive contact online and by telephone before finally arranging their date on 4 November 2013.
The video Guenzel made was played during the trial, at one point showing him covered in blood while mutilating the corpse. ""I never thought I would sink so low,"" he can be heard murmuring.
The defendant is reported to have broken down when the footage was shown, telling presiding judge Birgit Wiegand that he had made a mistake but was not a murderer.

229,"That dubious honour was imposed on her when, on 10 March, judges unanimously upheld parliament's decision in December to impeach her over a corruption scandal.
That scandal, which has generated huge protests, centres on her relationship with an old friend, and has brought allegations of cult activities, influence-peddling and leaks of classified information.
In 1974, Park Geun-hye's mother was killed by a North Korean spy who had intended to kill Ms Park's father, then-military leader Park Chung-hee. Ms Park, then aged 22, became a stand-in first lady for her widowed father.
It was then she got to know Choi Tae-min, a pseudo-Christian leader who set up a cult called The Church of Eternal Life. He said he had been visited by the soul of Ms Park's late mother who asked him to guide her.
He became Ms Park's mentor, while also amassing considerable wealth and power.
When President Park senior was assassinated by his head of intelligence in 1979, there was speculation it was because the spy chief was worried the president was being manipulated by the man dubbed ""the Korean Rasputin"".
By this point Ms Park was firm friends with Mr Choi's daughter, Choi Soon-sil. Their critics believe Ms Choi perpetuated her father's habits.
On 20 November, Ms Choi was charged with various offences, including abuse of authority, coercion, attempted coercion and attempted fraud. She is now on trial.
Few claims have been off-limits in the media coverage, with some reports going as far as suggesting the president is a puppet who hosted shamanist rituals at the presidential compound. But many of the lurid claims are unsubstantiated.
Ms Choi is accused of using her presidential connections to pressure companies for millions of dollars in donations to two non-profit foundations she controlled.
The claims have even swept up Samsung in the investigation - the firm is one of eight that has admitted making payments to the foundation, but denies it did so in return for any favours.
President Park is alleged to have been personally involved, instructing Ms Choi and two presidential aides to collect money for the launch of Ms Choi's foundations, according to prosecution documents submitted to the court.
Ms Choi is also accused of having received large numbers of confidential government documents from Ms Park, via an aide. These allegedly included information about ministerial candidates and North Korea.
There are even claims Ms Choi took advantage of the president's wardrobe budget - buying cheap outfits and keeping the change.
They have both apologised, but it remains unclear exactly what for.
When she was first questioned in October, Ms Choi said she had committed an ""unpardonable crime"", though her lawyer said this was not a legal admission of guilt.
President Park has herself admitted some lapses. She says she did consult Ms Choi for advice, and that she helped her edit her speeches, but that this stopped once she had a team of advisers in place.
Witnesses have claimed that Ms Choi received briefings and official papers long after that occurred. Documents were also discovered on an unsecured tablet computer found in an old office of Ms Choi's.
But the tone of the president's pronouncements has changed over time. She began with opaque apologies: ""Regardless of what the reason may be, I am sorry that the scandal has caused national concern and I humbly apologise to the people.""
But she has moved on to ""heartbroken"" public confessions of naivety: ""Sad thoughts trouble my sleep at night. I realise that whatever I do, it will be difficult to mend the hearts of the people, and then I feel a sense of shame.""
She had said she was willing to be questioned by investigators, but has so far resisted their attempts to speak to her.
Her spokesman said the prosecutors' allegation that she colluded with Ms Choi was ""deeply regrettable"" and ""but a house of cards built on repeated imagination"".
Samsung's de facto head, Lee Jae-Yong, is now on trial on a string of corruption charges, including bribery and embezzlement.
Prosecutors allege Mr Lee, heir to South Korea's largest conglomerate, approved payments of 41bn won ($36m, Â£29m) to Ms Choi's foundations, to win government support for a big restructuring of Samsung.
He denies the allegations, as do four other Samsung executives facing trial.
- Grandson of Samsung founder  Lee Byung-chul, son of current chairman Lee Kun-hee.
- Also known as Jay Y Lee, the 48-year-old has spent his entire career in the company.
- Is vice chairman of Samsung Electronics and was nominated to join the firm's board in October 2016.
- Despite his arrest, still widely expected to take overall control of Samsung.
- Critics say his rise through Samsung has been due to his birth, not his business experience.
Mr Lee, also known as Jay Y Lee, is currently vice-chairman of Samsung Electronics. But since his father, Lee Kun-hee, suffered a heart attack in 2014, he is considered de facto boss of the entire Samsung Group conglomerate.
In a December parliamentary hearing, Samsung admitted giving a total of 20.4bn won to two foundations, but denied seeking favours.
Mr Lee also confirmed the firm gave a horse and money to help the equestrian career of Ms Choi's daughter, Chung Yoo-ra, something he said he regretted.
Investigators are assessing whether the payments bought support for a controversial merger of two Samsung affiliates.
Some investors opposed the deal, saying one of the affiliates's shares were undervalued, but support from a major shareholder, the state-run National Pension Service (NPS), helped the deal go through.
The official who oversaw the NPS has since been charged with putting pressure on managers to approve the merger, which strengthened Mr Lee's control over a key part of the conglomerate.
Several former presidential aides have been investigated.
An Chong-bum, Ms Park's former senior secretary for policy co-ordination, has been charged with abuse of authority, coercion and attempted coercion, and Jung Ho-sung is accused of passing classified presidential documents to Ms Choi.
Local media have also been busy finding colourful associates of Ms Choi who were close to the president, including various celebrities and her personal trainer, who was appointed as a presidential aide.
The impeachment verdict against Ms Park stripped her of presidential immunity. She could now face criminal charges.
The constitutional court's ruling, while not a criminal trial, will not have given her much hope she will avoid that.
It ruled she broke the law by allowing Ms Choi to meddle in state affairs, and breached guidelines on official secrets in leaking numerous documents.

Dozens were killed or injured in the violence on Monday, state media say. Many of the dead were shot by police.
Xinhua news agency said a knife-wielding gang attacked a police station and government offices in Yarkant, which is known as Shache in China.
The BBC's Damian Grammaticas in Beijing says it appears that among those killed were police officers and ethnic Han Chinese settlers. Dozens of people were injured, possibly by police firing.
Confirming what happened is difficult, as information is tightly controlled in China. Xinhua's article came out only several hours after international media outlets including the BBC reported the violence.
The BBC made several calls to various Xinjiang government offices but officials refused to answer questions.
A report by The Global Times quoted an unnamed insider as saying that the incident began when police checkpoints at Elixku discovered explosives, which led to clashes between the police and ""attackers"".
Some of these attackers escaped and later recruited others to attack the local government and police station, the report said.
But activists have disputed such accounts, saying the violence erupted as members of the local Uighur population protested against a crackdown on Muslims observing Ramadan.
Groups outside China representing the Uighur ethnic minority say China's policies towards Muslim Uighurs are repressive and cause significant resentment. The groups said they fear the latest violence would lead to even harsher policies towards Uighurs.
On Wednesday, prosecutors in the Xinjiang capital Urumqi formally charged prominent Uighur academic Ilham Tohti with separatism.
Professor Tohti, who says he is innocent, was detained in January and his case has drawn international criticism.
He has been critical of China's treatment of Uighurs but there is no record of Mr Tohti ever having supported the cause of separatism, BBC correspondents say.
Yarkant county lies in Xinjiang's far west, near the border with Tajikistan. The area is seen as the heartland of the Uighur minority.
Tensions between Uighurs and Han Chinese migrants have been rumbling for years, with some Uighurs opposing Chinese rule in Xinjiang.
But in recent months there has been an upsurge in Xinjiang-linked violence that authorities have attributed to Uighur separatists.
In May at least 31 people were killed when two cars crashed through an Urumqi market and explosives were thrown. In March, a mass stabbing at Kunming railway station killed 29 people.

""Mr Valcke is confident that when all the facts come out, it will be clear that he did absolutely nothing wrong in carrying out his duties for the good of Fifa and the sport.""
In September last year Valcke was put on leave and released from his duties until further notice after Fifa had ""been made aware of a series of allegations"" involving him.
His dismissal was confirmed in January and Fifa recommended he be banned from football for nine years.
Regarding the 12-year ban imposed on Friday, a Fifa statement said: ""Amongst other things, the adjudicatory chamber found that a sports marketing firm had gained an undue advantage from the selling of World Cup tickets.
""In this respect, not only did Mr Valcke do nothing to stop these activities, he even encouraged the persons responsible to do so.
""By travelling at Fifa's expense purely for sightseeing reasons, as well as repeatedly choosing private flights for his trips over commercial flights without any business rationale for doing so, Mr Valcke gained an advantage for himself and relatives.
""In doing so, Mr Valcke acted against Fifa's best interests and caused considerable financial damage to Fifa.
""Concerning the issue of TV and media rights for the Caribbean, it was found that Mr Valcke attempted to grant the TV and media rights for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to a third party for a fee far below their actual market value and had taken concrete preparatory action in this regard.
""Furthermore, it was found that Mr Valcke deliberately tried to obstruct the ongoing proceedings against him by attempting to delete or deleting several files and folders relevant to the investigation, despite being aware of his duty to preserve all data and to collaborate in order to establish the facts of the case.""

233,"Mr Lochte had claimed that he and a group of three other US swimmers had been robbed at a petrol station.
But CCTV footage contradicted that story, showing the men had vandalised the petrol station.
Mr Lochte told Globo TV, Brazil's largest broadcaster, that he had not lied over what happened.
""I wasn't lying to a certain extent,"" he said. ""I over-exaggerated what was happening to me.""
He added that he was sorry, saying: ""Brazil doesn't deserve that.""

US cringes at Ryan Lochte 'bro' antics
Five times Lochte made a splash
News of the alleged robbery emerged through Mr Lochte's mother last Sunday.
Mr Lochte then gave an account of the events, saying he and the other swimmers were returning by taxi from a club in the early hours of the morning when they were robbed at gunpoint by men who forced the vehicle to pull over.
However, police said a day later that there were inconsistencies in the men's accounts.
On Wednesday, two of the men, Gunnar Bentz and Jack Conger, were taken off a US-bound plane at Rio de Janeiro airport and questioned by police.
Both were eventually allowed to leave the country. Another swimmer, Jimmy Feigen agreed to pay $11,000 to a Brazilian charity after the incident.
On Friday, Mr Conger said in a statement that Mr Lochte had pulled a metal advertisement in a frame to the ground, but Mr Conger said he was ""unsure why"".
He also said Mr Lochte began yelling at guards for an unknown reason. The men then agreed to pay the guards for the damage.
Rio de Janeiro's mayor Eduardo Paes had told media he felt nothing but ""shame and contempt"" towards the men for their portrayal of what happened.
In a separate interview with the US network NBC, part of which also aired on Saturday night, Mr Lochte said he felt ""hurt"" watching footage of his team-mates being taken off their plane. Mr Lochte had already returned to the United States from Brazil.
""I mean, I let my team down and you know, I don't want them to think I left them out to dry,"" he said.
However, he maintained the men were threatened and made to pay.
""Whether you call it a robbery or whether you call it extortion or us just paying for the damages, we don't know. All we know is that there was a gun pointed in our direction and we were demanded to give money.""
Lochte is one of the most successful swimmers in history, with 12 Olympic medals, and he once had his own reality television show in the US. In Rio, he swam in two events, winning gold in the 4x200m freestyle relay along with Conger.
Feigen won gold in the 4x100m freestyle relay.
Bentz competed in the 4x200m preliminaries, but not the final. He still received a gold medal after the US team's win.","US swimmer Ryan Lochte has apologised to the people of Brazil after ""over-exaggerating"" claims he was robbed at gunpoint while at the Rio Olympics.",37147031

Philips will focus on consumer goods and medical technology.
Lumileds, as the new business will be known, will have 8,300 employees worldwide and had sales in 2014 of more than €2bn (£1.45bn).
""We expect to see significant growth and unparalleled inroads into new opportunities such as electric vehicles,"" said Go Scale chairman Sonny Wu.

The prime minister told the BBC the election was ""obviously a close contest"" that would go ""down to the wire"".
Beginning his last push for votes on Tuesday, Mr Cameron said only a Conservative government could keep the UK moving forward, warning of the ""chaos"" of a Labour government supported by the SNP.
With opinion polls indicating no single party will win a majority of seats at Westminster, Ms Wood will say on Wednesday the ""stranglehold of the old parties"" is now at an end.
""I want the strongest possible team of Plaid Cymru MPs so that I have the strongest possible hand when I go up to London on Friday to make Wales' voice heard loud and clear,"" she will say.

He was told complaints were made by gay prisoners and alleges he was unfairly dismissed.
His case against the secretary of state for justice continues.
Mr Trayhorn, 51, an ordained Pentecostal Christian minister from Sandy in Bedfordshire, had been working as a gardening supervisor at the prison at Perry near St Neots.
He had been invited to lead the worship at services once a week from 2012.
He told the tribunal in Bedford, he ""often focused on Christian teachings about sin and repentance"".
He confirmed the Bible passage in question was 1 Corinthians Chapter 6 Verses 9-11 which includes the lines ""neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites, nor thieves, nor coveters, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the Kingdom of God"" and he read it on 31 May 2014.
Mr Trayhorn said he heard later that a gay prisoner had complained or was upset and there was ""some sort of campaign"" to remove him from chapel services.
""But I fear and do not believe it is right to alter the Christian faith so as to tailor it to any modern view of sexual ethics,"" he told the hearing.
He said he was told he could no longer volunteer at chapel services, complaints were then also made about his gardening work and he was told to attend a disciplinary hearing in a letter which said he had made a ""homophobic statement"".

Roy Hodgson's side were knocked out of Euro 2012 by Italy on penalties.
""I don't attach any blame to Roy Hodgson,"" Shearer told BBC Sport. ""But I don't go along with the idea England go home with their heads held high.
""It's no good sitting here saying we will win the World Cup in two years' time. The reality is we will not.""
""Alan Shearer's outspoken comments about England will strike a chord with those who believe Euro 2012 confirmed that a change of football culture is needed in this country.
""They may not go down well with the players who fought so hard against a vastly-superior Italy before losing in the quarter-final in Kiev, but he is only echoing the thoughts of many.""
Hodgson's side were beaten by Italy last Sunday after being outclassed in a goalless draw in Kiev.
England's players won plaudits for an improved performance in Poland and Ukraine, after a disastrous World Cup in South Africa in 2010.
Germany coach Joachim Loew - who masterminded a 4-1 thrashing of Fabio Capello's side two years ago - has praised Hodgson's management, and said that ""England will develop under him in the next few years.""
But Shearer sees a vast gulf in quality between England and the likes of Spain and Loew's Germany side.
""The big thing people have spoken about is the togetherness and work ethic but if you just want 11 guys to go out and work hard, I can find you 11 men from Newcastle city centre who will work their socks off,"" he said.
""That has to be a given, whether at a club or even more so for an international team.
""We are a million miles away from the top sides. Heads held high? Do you think France will go home to that reception?
""It's a sign of how far behind we are now that we can go home and say we can hold our heads up high for getting into the quarter finals.""
The Football Association recently voted in proposals for youth coaching which include smaller-sided games on smaller pitches with smaller goals.
But Shearer believes any progress on the international stage will need a vast improvement in the coaching culture of the country, which could take years.
He said: ""We have got to get out of the habit of going to tournaments thinking we can win it. This tournament has proven that. We need a change in culture and to be fair to the FA they are trying to change things now.
""It's going to take time to put these systems in place. Our league is the best in the world for entertainment but only because it is full of foreigners.""
Fellow England international and BBC Sport pundit Lee Dixon also called for changes.
""Let's remind ourselves where we were two years ago under Capello,"" he said. ""We have come on, the team was an absolute shambles. We have repaired that but we haven't moved forwards football-wise.

243,"The prime minister said it was her party's ""firm intention to reduce taxes on ordinary working families"".
But Sir Michael Fallon said in the Daily Telegraph that there would be no rise in income tax for higher earners.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the Conservatives' tax policies were in ""chaos"".
The Conservative manifesto scrapped a pledge made by David Cameron in 2015 not to raise VAT, national insurance or income tax.
Speaking in West Yorkshire Mrs May said: ""Our position on tax hasn't changed. We have set it out in the manifesto.
""What people will know when they go to vote on Thursday is that it is the Conservative party that always has been and is and always will be a low tax party and it is our firm intention to reduce taxes for ordinary working families.""
However, in his Telegraph interview, Sir Michael appeared to go further than Mrs May.
He said voting Conservative was ""the only way"" people could be sure income tax would not be hiked.
Asked if high earners could confidently vote Conservative next week, safe in the knowledge that their income tax would not go up, Sir Michael said: ""Yes.
""You've seen our record. We're not in the business of punishing people for getting on, on the contrary we want people to keep more of their earnings.
""The only way they can be sure their taxes won't rise is to vote Conservative. We already know your tax will go up if you vote Labour on Thursday.""
The Conservative manifesto had committed the party to keeping tax ""as low as possible"" but had not ruled out increases in income tax.
Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson later told BBC's Newsnight: ""We will bear down on taxation and we have absolutely no plans to raise income tax. Our plans are to cut taxes. Labour's plans are to put them up.""
Former Conservative work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith told BBC Breakfast the party was trying to get away from the ""idea that you set out every single thing in detail saying we won't do this, we won't do that, we won't do the other because then you get a large shopping list"".
At the 2015 general election, David Cameron promised that income tax, National Insurance, and VAT - the so-called ""triple lock"" - would not go up under a Conservative government.
That promise led to a U-turn earlier this year when Mrs May's government had to ditch plans to raise National Insurance contributions for the self-employed.
The Tories have pledged not to raise VAT but to increase the personal allowance to £12,500 and raise the minimum earnings for the 40p higher rate to £50,000 by 2020.
Sir Michael Fallon's comments were a signal to the Tory base - designed to reassure core supporters that their taxes wouldn't go up under the Conservatives and make sure they turn out to vote.
There is no firm commitment though, no promise in writing unlike in the party's previous manifesto.
And Theresa May didn't go as far as her defence secretary, declining to make a new pledge - suggesting this isn't something she wants to be held to.
Labour have seized on the discrepancy as a sign of Conservative confusion - with Jeremy Corbyn reminding voters of his claim that 95% would pay no more tax if he won power.
All parties are fighting hard in these last few remaining days of campaigning to make sure their key messages get through.
Opposition parties seized on Sir Michael's comments.
""One minister says they're going to give no more tax rises - indeed possibly tax reductions for the very wealthiest - then they can't answer the question about tax rises for the rest of the population,"" Mr Corbyn said.
""Let's be clear - what Labour are offering is no tax rises or national insurance rises or VAT rises for 95% of the population.""
Former Lib Dem business secretary Sir Vince Cable asked where the money was coming from to pay for Sir Michael's apparent promise.
""Since they are ruling out increases in income, corporate tax and VAT we must assume that there will be an increase in national insurance and in various 'stealth taxes' yet to be specified. It undoubtedly raises suspicions,"" he said.
The SNP's Stewart Hosie said Sir Michael had ""let the cat out of the bag"", adding: ""Tory plans for a tax freeze for the richest in society were clearly airbrushed out of their manifesto.""
Labour has promised to raise the income tax rate to 45p for earnings above £80,000 and to 50p for each pound earned over £123,000.
It says it will not raise income tax for those earning less than £80,000.
It says the planned rises for higher earners will help fund billions of pounds of investment for schools and the NHS and an expansion of free childcare, in what it calls a ""programme of hope"".
Meanwhile the Liberal Democrats have pledged to increase income tax by a penny to help pay for the NHS, social care and mental health.
The SNP says it would support the idea of raising the top rate of income tax for those earning more than £150,000 from 45p to 50p.
It says there would be no increase in taxation on the low paid, in national insurance or in VAT.

244,"Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters the allegation was an ""official accusation"" and a ""total fabrication"".
Adam Szubin, who oversees US Treasury sanctions, told BBC Panorama that the US government had known Mr Putin was corrupt for ""many, many years"".
It is thought to be the first time the US has made such a direct accusation.
Washington has already imposed sanctions on Mr Putin's aides, but has stopped short of levelling corruption allegations at the president himself.
US restrictions were placed on a number of Kremlin insiders in 2014, after President Putin ordered the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and conflict broke out in eastern Ukraine. The EU imposed similar measures against Russian companies and individuals, focusing on sectors of the Russian economy that were close to the elite.
The US government stated at the time that President Putin had secret investments in the energy sector.
Mr Peskov told reporters in Moscow that the Panorama allegations would have looked like ""another classic case of irresponsible journalism, if not for an official comment from a representative of the US finance ministry"".
As such it was an official accusation. ""It clearly shows who is directing this,"" said Mr Peskov, who added that such an allegation required proof, to show that the statements were not unfounded slander.
In the programme, Mr Szubin spoke of how ""we've seen [Mr Putin] enriching his friends, his close allies, and marginalising those who he doesn't view as friends using state assets"", whether it concerned Russia's energy wealth or state contracts. ""To me, that is a picture of corruption,"" he said.
US government officials have been reluctant to be interviewed about President Putin's wealth, and Mr Szubin would not comment on a secret CIA report from 2007 that estimated it at around $40bn (Â£28bn).
But he said the Russian president had been amassing secret wealth. ""He supposedly draws a state salary of something like $110,000 a year. That is not an accurate statement of the man's wealth, and he has long time training and practices in terms of how to mask his actual wealth.""
President Putin declined to be interviewed for Panorama but the Kremlin denies such allegations.
In 2008, President Putin personally addressed claims that he was the richest man in Europe, saying: ""It's simply rubbish. They just picked all of it out of someone's nose and smeared it across their little papers.""
The Panorama programme came days after a UK public inquiry said Mr Putin had ""probably"" approved the murder of ex-spy Alexander Litvinenko.
Mr Peskov pointed out that the programme had coincided with ""quasi-court proceedings"" and said that the Kremlin was used to such ""false-reporting"", whether it was the result of incompetence or an orchestrated campaign.
Litvinenko, a former Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) agent and fierce critic of Mr Putin, was poisoned in London with radioactive polonium in 2006.
Sir Robert Owen's report found that Mr Putin was likely to have signed off the attack in part due to personal ""antagonism"" between the president and Litvinenko. The Russian foreign ministry rejected the report as neither transparent nor unbiased.
The recent tensions between Moscow and London have seen pro-Kremlin media invoke a colourful phrase that harks back to the 19th-Century rivalry known as the Great Game.
""Anglichanka gadit"" or ""The Englishwoman does the dirty"" is the Russian equivalent of the French term ""perfidious Albion "".
The female gender possibly refers to Queen Victoria or Britannia.
TV presenter Dmitriy Kiselev used the phrase no fewer than nine times in his commentary on the Litvinenko inquiry on Sunday.
He suggested the affair was the latest in a long line of British double-crossings, including the murder of Tsar Paul I in 1801 and Winston Churchill's call for a nuclear attack on the USSR after World War Two.

Mervyn was chosen in recognition of his his commitment and dedication to the youth programme at Ballinamallard United Football Club.
The County Fermanagh man has been instrumental in the setting up and co-ordinating of the Mini Soccer and youth programmes at the club on a voluntary basis since 1996.
Since then, he has given an extraordinary amount of his time and effort towards ensuring that their youth programme are fully inclusive regardless of gender, background or age.
The Mini Soccer League, which now has 230 children enrolled, has seen nearly 40 children represent Northern Ireland since 1996.
Mervyn has proven his dedication to all elements of the club - as well as being Chairman of the Youth Committee, a key member for the Ground Development committee and fundraising for the club, he has also taken responsibility for washing the kits and mowing the grass - that is before the installation of their new 3G pitch.
He was announced as the winner of the BBC Sports Unsung Hero award 2014 for Northern Ireland on Tuesday 18 November.
Now in its 12th year, the BBC Sports Unsung Hero Award recognises and rewards outstanding contribution by individuals at the grassroots level of local sport, who give up their time on a voluntary basis so that sport can be played and enjoyed by people throughout the UK.
Mervyn now progresses to the Unsung Hero final as the regional winner for Northern Ireland.
""I am absolutely delighted and honoured to receive BBC NI's Unsung Hero Award - it was a total surprise,"" admitted Mervyn.
""I would like to accept the award on behalf of everyone at Ballinamallard United as recognition of the many hours put in by all the committee and coaches who provide the opportunity for everyone in our community to enjoy football. It will be a great honour to represent our Club and at the main awards night in Glasgow.""
Ballinamallard United manager Whitey Anderson said: ""Nobody deserves this accolade more than Mervyn - the time, dedication and passion that he has given to the club and particularly to the youth programme over the past two decades is remarkable.
""We are very fortunate that he is such an integral part of Ballinamallard United and on behalf of the team and all the staff I want to congratulate Mervyn and wish him all the best for the national awards in December.""
There will be 15 regional winners of a Get Inspired Unsung Hero award from across the UK, who will attend the star-studded 60th BBC Sports Personality of the Year show, on Sunday 14 December at the SSE Hydro, Glasgow where an overall Unsung Hero winner will be announced.
Jane Tohill, Executive producer, Sport, BBC Northern Ireland, said: ""Mervyn is a very worthy winner of the BBC Northern Ireland's Get Inspired Unsung Hero Sports Unsung Hero title in Northern Ireland as he provides an outlet for many people who may not otherwise have the chance to get involved with sport.
""As in previous years, it has been difficult to pick a winner from those who were nominated - there are so many people here who make such a valuable contribution to their sport and to their area. Thanks to all who nominated their Unsung Heroes.

250,"St Mary's University says free meals can be a ""misleading"" marker for deprivation in schools.
The study warns of the need to support the ""hidden poor"".
Offiicial figures recently showed two-thirds of children in poverty are now in working families.
Free school meals have been widely used as a way of looking at the social profile of schools - but the research argues that this has failed to reflect changes in the labour market and financial pressures on low-income working families.
The study by St Mary's University in south-west London looks at pupils receiving free meals in Catholic schools in England and Wales.
Faith schools have faced accusations of being socially selective - and in Catholic schools, about 12% of pupils receive free meals, compared with a state school average of about 14%.
But the study from St Mary's, a Catholic higher education institution, argues that such figures have become an ""an unreliable indicator"" of hardship.
It says if the same schools are assessed by another official measure of poverty - the Income Deprivation Affecting Children Index - the outcome is reversed, with disproportionately high levels of pupils in Catholic schools living in the most deprived areas.
The study says that counting poverty by the take-up of free meals can miss the ""working poor"" who are in temporary and often low-paid jobs, moving in and out of employment.
Figures from the Department for Work and Pensions show that children in poverty are now more likely to be in working families than non-working families.
Among children identified as being in poverty, 67% are in families with at least one parent working, the highest recorded level.
Prime Minister Theresa May has spoken of the need to help ""just about managing families"", where parents might be working long hours in multiple jobs.
Such working families might be facing hardship, but might not be eligible for free meals.
Eligibility for free school meals is for families in receipt of a range of benefits and with an income below Â£16,190 - but families on working tax credits are excluded.
Pupils taking free meals are also used to decide how much money schools receive in the pupil premium, targeting funding at disadvantaged youngsters.
The research by Prof Stephen Bullivant also highlights that the measurement of free school meals pupils is based on take-up, rather than eligibility.
There are parents who might be eligible but who do not accept free meals - because of a stigma around children being identified or because of ""cultural"" reasons for not wanting to accept welfare.
The research warns that focusing on free school meal eligibility can provide an inaccurate picture of the social intake of the rest of a school.
""Free school meals eligibility is taken as 'poor' children - and any not getting free meals are seen to be affluent and middle class,"" said Prof Bullivant.
But he says many families face ""precarious lives"" and are ""struggling to make ends meet"", but will not show up in free meals figures.
""Class inequality is a real problem in Britain affecting children's attainment. This data fails to understand different degrees of poverty,"" says Prof Bullivant.
""At a time when schools are facing funding struggles, a multi-faceted approach is needed to ensure that children from deprived backgrounds, who are currently unaccounted for by the system - the 'hidden poor' - receive the targeted support they need.""","Counting the proportion of pupils taking free school meals is an increasingly unreliable way of measuring poverty and the fairness of admissions policies, researchers say.",39479028

252,"When the English monarch, nicknamed Richard the Lionheart, died in 1199 his heart was embalmed and buried separately from the rest of his body.
Its condition was too poor to reveal the cause of death, but the team was able to rule out a theory that he had been killed by a poisoned arrow.
The researchers were also able to find out more about the methods used to preserve his organ.
The study is published in the journal Scientific Reports.
The medieval king became known as Richard the Lionheart because of his reputation as a courageous military leader.
He was central to the Third Crusade, fighting against the Muslim leader Saladin.
Although he ruled England, he spent much of his time in France, and was killed there after being hit by a crossbow bolt during a siege on a castle.
After his death, his body was divided up - a common practice for aristocracy during the Middle Ages.
His entrails were buried in Chalus, which is close to Limoges in central France. The rest of his body was entombed further north, in Fontevraud Abbey, but his heart was embalmed and buried in the cathedral of Notre Dame in Rouen.
The remains of his heart -  now a grey-brown powder - were locked away in a small lead box, and discovered in the 19th Century during an excavation.
But until now, they had not been studied in detail.
To find out more, a team of forensic specialists and historians performed a biological analysis.
Dr Philippe Charlier, a forensic scientist from Raymond Poincare University Hospital, in France, said: ""We carried out exactly the same kind of analysis that we would perform on an exhumed body for forensic purposes.
""We did a microscopic examination, toxicological analysis and also a pollen analysis.""
Time of death
The heart was too badly decomposed to confirm exactly how the king died - most historians believe gangrene or septicaemia from his wound would have been the cause.
However, another, less widespread theory put forward in a medieval chronicle is that Richard I may have been killed by an arrow coated in poison.
But Dr Charlier said his tests revealed that this probably was not the case.
""Our toxicological analysis showed no presence of any arsenic or any other metals, so we haven't found any proof of any contamination during the end of Richard the Lionheart's life,"" he explained.
""We have no confirmation that he would have been poisoned: there is no argument for this.""
The team found pollen in the sample, including grains from poplar and bellflower. This suggests that Richard I died at the end of April, May or the beginning of June, as these plants are in flower then.  In the history books, his date of death is given as 6 April 1199.
The analysis also revealed much more about the techniques that were used to preserve his heart - providing an insight into medieval religious rituals.
Dr Charlier said: ""The spices and vegetables used for the embalming process were directly inspired by the ones used for the embalming of Christ.
""For example, we found frankincense. This is the only case known of using frankincense  - we have never found any use of this before. This product is really devoted to very, very important persons in history.""
The heart, which was wrapped in linen, also had traces of myrtle, daisy, mint and possibly lime.
The scientists think these would have been used for their smell, to give the King an ""odour of sanctity"", which would be ""similar to Christ"".
They also found mercury, which would have been used stop the heart from decomposing.
Dr Charlier said that during the post-mortem, they used up as little material as possible.
He explained: ""We wanted to conserve it for the future generations.
""These are not only samples, they are also human remains and we have to respect them.""
Mark Ormrod, professor in history from the University of York, said the research was extremely interesting.
""That consciousness of using very high-quality herbs and spices and other materials that are much sought after and rare does add to that sense of it being Christ-like in its quality,"" he said.
""Medieval kings were thought to represent the divine on Earth - they were set apart form other lay people and regarded as special and different. So that treatment of the heart strikes me as being absolutely credible.""
He added that it was rare to get a forensic insight into the remains of medieval kings - and that this study and the work done on the remains of Richard III, who was recently found buried under a car park in Leicester, were unusual.
He said: ""Generally speaking, when human remains are found on consecrated ground, the church, the state and the law all prevent one from undertaking any scientific analysis of them, so the opportunities to do these kinds of things are very rare.""",The mummified heart of King Richard I has been analysed by forensic experts.,21609783
253,"Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford said the figures showed Welsh councils were protected from the worst of Westminster imposed cuts.
The statistics show the average Band D council tax in Wales in 2017-18 is £1,420 - £171 less than in England.
But the Conservatives accused ministers of ""shameless spin"" and the Liberal Democrats said some Welsh councils had seen ""eye-watering"" council tax rises.
The average rise in Band D council tax in England is 4%, compared to 3.3% in Wales.
And this the first time in nine years that Wales' Band D increase has been lower than England's.
In cash terms, the average increase is £46, with Powys taxpayers seeing the biggest rise, of £62.  The lowest annual rise is £19, in Caerphilly.
The highest Band D charge is £1,754 in Blaenau Gwent, which has fewer properties rated at that level than anywhere else in Wales - around 1,500.
The lowest is £1,128 in Pembrokeshire, which has some 10,850 band D homes.
Mr Drakeford said: ""Councils here are facing some real financial challenges but these latest figures show we are protecting local government from the worst of the cuts handed down by Westminster and, in doing so, protecting the taxpayer; a situation that has not been replicated on the other side of the border.
""In 2017-18, we are increasing funding for local government by £10m compared to 2016-17.
""Under the funding floor we introduced in the Local Government Settlement, no council will have to manage on less than 99.5% of the cash provided to them last year, and most will have more.""
But Conservative local government spokesman Janet Finch-Saunders said: ""The average Welsh worker gets paid around £4,500 a year less than in England, so Labour's claims to have lower council tax bills is disgraceful.""
""Across Wales, the average Band D property has faced cumulative council tax hikes of around £627 since 2012 and residents know that it is only a Conservative council that will fight for fairer council tax bills.""
Former Liberal Democrat AM Peter Black, the party's local government spokesman, said that ""while the average council tax bill in Wales is lower than in England, we've still seen eye-watering increases by some local councils year on year"".
""Council tax is one of the most unfair taxes in society, and hits the poorest hardest, which is why we will deliver better, more effective public services so no community is left behind,"" he said.
Plaid Cymru AM Sian Gwenllian said through a budget deal with ministers and by putting pressure on the Labour administration in Cardiff Bay her party had secured extra money for local government and help with council tax bills for lower income households.
""Plaid Cymru has always taken action to secure a fair deal for council taxpayers, as well as protecting our vital local services,"" she said.",Figures have confirmed that council tax remains lower in Wales than England.,39366769

Legal aid was refused when the case was deemed ""not in the public interest"".
The family disputes tests which suggest Zane died of carbon monoxide poisoning.
Surrey Police checked a petrol-driven water pump taken from the riverside property.
Zane's parents, Kye Gbangbola and Nicole Lawler, believe their son was killed by hydrogen cyanide from contaminated floodwater in a former landfill site next door.
Hospital blood tests revealed the gas was present in the whole family.
The Legal Aid Agency said it was now considering a new application after it suggested the parents provide further evidence.
The shadow home secretary Andy Burnham has called on the Justice Secretary Michael Gove to intervene.
In a letter, he wrote: ""It seems utterly unjust for this family, who have been living every parents' worst nightmare and are now on the brink of bankruptcy, to be thrown into a court room for the inquest on their child without proper legal support and representation.

The Surrey coroner Richard Travers wrote to the family to say the case would be complex and his court ""would be better assisted"" if they had representation.
In March, the Prime Minister David Cameron told BBC Surrey: ""Inquests are generally carried out in a way that people do not need a lawyer... and can get to the truth and participate fully.

An announcement was expected to be made over the weekend during Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's visit to India.
China is also bidding to build high-speed bullet train lines in India.
The highly-anticipated multi-billion dollar deal is being touted as one of the biggest foreign investments in India's ageing infrastructure.
""We expect to make an announcement during the visit,"" the official told Reuters, adding that issues had been sorted out ahead of Prime Minister's Abe visit, which begins on Friday.
The bullet train line is expected to link the financial capital Mumbai and Ahmedabad in the state of Gujurat, cutting the 505km journey from at least eight hours to just two.
Japan is expected to lend India more than half the cost for the project - about $8bn - at very low interest rates for up to 50 years.
The Modi government has committed to invest $137bn in the country's vast, but antiquated railway system over the next five years.

Google said it would review its controls.
The firm has been attacked by MPs in the past for not doing more to curb online hate speech.
The internet giant said it had ""strict guidelines"" about the placement of adverts but conceded ""we don't always get it right"".
A recent investigation by the Times found adverts were appearing alongside content from supporters of extremist groups, making them around Â£6 per 1,000 viewers, as well as making money for the company.
Ministers have summoned Google for talks at the Cabinet Office after imposing a temporary restriction on its own ads - including for military recruitment and blood donation campaigns - appearing on YouTube.
The Cabinet Office said digital platforms such as YouTube were a ""cost-effective"" way of reaching mass audiences but the taxpayer demanded high standards and it would be seeking action following recent negative media coverage.
""Google is responsible for ensuring the high standards applied to government advertising are adhered to and that adverts do not appear alongside inappropriate content,"" a spokesman said.
""We have placed a temporary restriction on our YouTube advertising pending reassurances from Google that government messages can be delivered in a safe and appropriate way.""

Both attacks looked capable of scoring tries almost at will during an exhilarating first half.
Clemont fly-half Camille Lopez's artistry was a feature of the opening period as his ability to break at pace and fast hands helped set up Yato's second-minute try and full-back Spedding's 31st-minute score, which put the visitors 18-15 ahead.
But Lopez's opposite number Jackson became even more influential with his delicious flat pass setting up a charging Marshall to score in the seventh minute before a chip and chase yielded his own opportunist 35th-minute score to leave Ulster 22-18 ahead at half-time.
Jackson's half-back partner Ruan Pienaar was instrumental to Henderson's 16th-minute try as the South African reacted to an advantage call from referee Wayne Barnes to hoist a gorgeous crosskick which Tommy Bowe fielded above Spedding before off-loading for the man of the match to score.
The teams swapped the lead on seven occasions in the opening period as Jackson kicked seven points, with Morgan Parra notching eight with the boot for the Top 14 leaders.
Crucially, Ulster were able to maintain their tempo after the resumption as Marshall crashed over for his second try in the 46th minute before Piutau's dancing feet outwitted Spedding and Remi Lamerat after a superb looping pass from Jackson.
Two more Jackson conversions and his second penalty left a possible rout on the cards at 39-18 after 58 minutes but the French giants responded impressively as Abendanon's try was followed by Chouly's 72nd-minute score to leave only seven points between the sides.
Ah You's yellow card two minutes later further increased the pressure on the home side but composed play from Pienaar helped see the game out.
Ulster's director of rugby Les Kiss: ""From a performance perspective it was brilliant.
""There were a lot of good things in terms of the outcome but parts of the process were a little bit disappointing as we let [Wesley] Fofana have too much room in that first half.

264,"Samia Shahid, 28, from Bradford, was strangled last month in Northern Punjab, police in Pakistan said.
Cleric Syed Sibtami Kazmi said he was ""threatened"" after Ms Shahid's second marriage in September 2014.
Her second husband Syed Mukhtar Kazam believes she was killed because her family disapproved of their marriage.
Ms Shahid's family claims she died from natural causes.
Mr Kazmi, a prayer leader at Anjuman-e-Haideria, a Shia mosque in Bradford, said Ms Shahid approached him in May 2014 seeking an Islamic divorce from her first husband Choudhry Shakeel.
""She told me under oath that her first marriage was a forced marriage, which happened without her free will as she was pressurised into the marriage by her family,"" he said.
She was accompanied by two witnesses who signed her divorce papers.
Mr Kazmi said after writing to her first husband, who declined to give his version of events, he declared the marriage void.
He also performed the religious ceremony for Ms Shahid to marry her second husband.
Ms Shahid converted to her new husband's Shia denomination of Islam prior to her second marriage, although her family are Sunni.
The cleric said that once the Shahid family became aware of the marriage they contacted him for clarification.
He said he expressed ignorance so as not to compromise Ms Shahid's safety and, some months later, he received a threatening call from a family member.
Mr Kazmi quoted an unnamed member of her family as saying: ""(Ms Shahid) is missing from home and you know where she is. The issue will be resolved but you will have to pay a high price for your role.""
The cleric said: ""I recorded all these threats and handed them over to police without any delay.""
He said on the basis of his complaint the police spoke to the family and officers had given him safety advice.
The prayer leader said he initially went to the police station to lodge his complaint and police visited him later.
""It was a long process which continued from two to three months,"" he said, adding that apart from these two visits there were numerous contacts on telephone and text messages.
Mr Kazam confirmed to the BBC he was aware of Mr Kazmi's claim and that both he and his wife had also been threatened by a member of Ms Shahid's family around the same time.
Ms Shahid's family could not be contacted for comment, but have previously said she died of a heart attack.
West Yorkshire Police said it was reviewing the case.
""Her death remains a matter for the Pakistani authorities and we are continuing to liaise with them and with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office,"" the force said.
Post-mortem tests revealed her death was a result of strangulation.
No arrests have been made but Ms Shahid's father and a cousin known as Mobeen have both been interviewed by officers.
Mr Shakeel, who was previously reported to be on the run, is in Pakistan on pre-arrest bail order, which means police know his whereabouts, but cannot arrest, or demand to interview him, until the order expires on Saturday.",A cleric who conducted an Islamic marriage ceremony involving an alleged honour killing victim claims he was threatened by a member of her family.,36981662

266,"It comprises an array of 180 small lenses, which, along with their associated electronics, are stretched across a curved mounting.
The prototype currently has few pixels, so its images are low-resolution.
But the device displays an immense depth of field, and a very wide-angle view that avoids the distortion seen in standard camera lenses.
The development team, led from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, US, believes its new imaging system could eventually find uses in surveillance and for endoscopic investigations of the human body.
In their report, the researchers also suggest such cameras could be fitted to tiny aerial vehicles one day that behaved like robotic insects.
At the moment, the ""bug-eye"" system's vision is comparable to that enjoyed by some ants and beetles.
The expectation, however, is that the array can be greatly enlarged.
""The compound design of the fly's eye incorporates perhaps 28,000 small eyes, or ommatidia,"" explained team-member Dr Jianliang Xiao from the University of Colorado at Boulder, US.  ""That's the direction we want to move in,"" he told BBC News.
In an insect, each ommatidium in the compound eye has a corneal lens, a crystalline cone and a light-sensitive organ at its base. The ommatidia work in unison to build a picture of the world.
In the artificial version, microlenses sit above photodetectors and other electronics, and software stitches together the individual signals.
This whole arrangement is fabricated flat and then moulded to a hemispherical shape to give a 160-degree view. The latest generation of stretchable electronics was key to achieving the desired  geometry.
Scientists are keen to exploit the advantages of compound eyes.
For one, they show remarkable depth of field - they can focus on objects at different distances at the same time.  They also do not suffer from the aberrations seen in single lens systems when viewing off-axis objects. A good example is the huge distortion observed in wide-angle camera lenses such as the fish-eye.
For an insect, their compound system capabilities make them very sensitive to movement.
""Our system could eventually be used in surveillance cameras. One device of this kind could see 180 degrees.  If you had two, you could then conceivably see the whole field of view,"" said Dr Xiao.
Alexander Borst and Johannes Plett are from the Max-Planck-Institute of Neurobiology in Martinsried, Germany.  They are not connected with the research but speculated for Nature on other possible future applications.
""Picture the following: a palm-sized micro aerial vehicle uses an artificial faceted eye to navigate autonomously through a collapsed building while other sensors onboard scan the environment for smoke, radioactivity or even people trapped beneath rubble and debris,"" they wrote in the journal.",A digital camera that functions like an insect's compound eye is reported in the journal Nature this week.,22372442

The following year, Iain Provan, Elizabeth Allan and Len Stern lost their lives at the Jim Clark Rally near Coldstream.
The inquiry at Edinburgh Sheriff Court is expected to last several weeks with dozens of people due to give evidence.
Plans to hold the hearing were confirmed late last year.
The decision followed a change in legislation to allow for a single fatal accident inquiry to be held in relation to deaths in different parts of Scotland.
The Crown Office said at the time that the two events held ""similar questions in relation to spectator safety at rallies"".
It added that the Lord Advocate considered that it was in the public interest that the issues be explored together.
The inquiry will look at the full circumstances surrounding the deaths and ""help to avoid such incidents happening in the future"".
Andrew Henderson, from Thompsons Solicitors, who is representing Mrs Robson's family said: ""Joy's family greatly welcome the beginning of the fatal accident inquiry which is the first to be held since new legislation was brought in to improve the FAI process.
""They want to finally know the full reasons behind Joy losing her life and to make sure that spectator safety at Scottish rallies can be improved to a level where no other family can suffer a bereavement in such an awful and needless way.""

The company was quoted on Monday by French news website Les Inrocks as saying that the hours of work, particularly during busy periods, meant the candidate should not be someone with cultural or religious needs.
NSL Studio then tweeted that its advert had been hacked and thanked those who had brought the issue to its attention.

He described Gray as Butler's partner, not his daughter, as he had disowned her.
He said he and his wife ""fought tooth and nail"" to keep Ellie but were seen as ""troublemakers"".
Mr Gray has called for a public inquiry into the case, adding: ""Everybody failed Ellie completely and utterly.""
More on this story and other news from London
The youngster went back to live with her parents 11 months before her death.
Butler, 36, was convicted of her murder on Tuesday and jailed for a minimum of 23 years. Ellie's mother (Mr Gray's daughter) was found guilty of child cruelty but had admitted perverting the course of justice. She was jailed for 42 months.
The exonerated father who went on to kill
Butler was convicted in 2009 for shaking Ellie as a baby, although this was later quashed on appeal.
The couple then won a High Court judgement to have Ellie returned to their care in 2012.
Mrs Justice Hogg sided with Butler despite objections from police, social services and Ellie's maternal grandfather, Mr Gray.
""We tried to fight it tooth and nail but every time we protested we were told we were troublemakers and we were elderly people and we weren't worthy of looking after children,"" Mr Gray said.
""I said I hope you all have a conscience because one day you might have blood on your hands.""
Mr Gray said he and his wife used to take Ellie to a children's centre for troubled families every few weeks to see her parents but in two-and-a-half years, her father went only twice and her mother went four times.
""She hadn't known them as parents,"" he said. ""But her mother turned around and said 'If you don't come back and live with mummy and daddy we won't love you anymore'.""
Mr Gray said he had hoped to adopt Ellie and care for her until she was 18.
""She was fantastic, very bubbly, a beautiful little girl, always on the go all the time, lots of energy like little children have, very brainy, nobody's fool. It was the best years of our life.""
He said Ellie had nightmares that social workers would come and return her back to her parents.
Mr Gray saw Ellie the day before she died, in October 2013.
""We had half an hour to see her and she wasn't the Ellie we knew.
""She had bruises on her forehead and scratches, her hair was all bedraggled. She had odd shoes, socks and clothes and looked as though she had been dragged through the back of a hedgerow.
""You could see her eyes were sunken and there was sadness in her eyes.""
He added: ""Stories from her and Butler saying she was rude and lazy are complete and utter false lies. She was a gorgeous little girl and it was a great privilege to be her grandparent.""
Speaking to the Victoria Derbyshire programme, he said: ""You don't think one of your own offspring could possibly be involved in a terrible, tragic crime. Unfortunately she was,"" he said.
""I understand he was violent and controlling but I think she's also capable of being the same with him.""
He added he thought the violence in the household was ""50/50"" between Butler and Gray, and that Gray should have been jailed for at least 20 years, and that Butler should have had 40 years.
""Jennie was aggressive and threatening. I had a premonition that Ellie wouldn't be safe.

Included in the shipment is an expandable room that will be fitted to the ISS in the coming weeks.
Also in the cargo are Chinese cabbage seeds that astronauts will attempt to grow in orbit, and a group of mice which will be used to test drugs that might help combat muscle and bone loss in the weightless environment of space.
Meanwhile back on Earth, the main stage of the Falcon rocket that sent the Dragon on its way to the station on Friday has returned to port in Florida.
The booster made a return to a drone ship stationed out in the Atlantic after completing its ascent - the first time in five attempts that SpaceX had managed to recover one of its vehicles at sea.
SpaceX CEO Elon Musk told reporters that the stage would now be re-fired on the ground to check its condition.

Prosecutors said the president's niece and his doctor were offered 1bn CFA francs (Â£1.2m; $2m) to poison him.
The three have been remanded in custody, officials say.
Prosecutors yesterday named them as Dr Ibrahim Mama Cisse, the president's niece Zouberath Kora-Seke and former minister of commerce Moudjaidou Soumanou.
Authorities said they also intended to issue an arrest warrant for businessman Patrice Talon, a former ally of Mr Yayi who fell out with the leader.
Chief prosecutor Justin Gbenameto told reporters that the alleged plot started on 17 October while the head of state was on an official visit to Brussels.
He said the president's niece, who accompanied him on that trip, was approached by Mr Talon who offered her money to administer drugs to the president, provided by his personal doctor.
Two days later the poison arrived on a flight from Brussels, he said. The prosecutor said that medicine which the president usually took was then replaced with the poison.
It is alleged that Mr Soumanou acted as an intermediary in the affair.

A suicide attacker detonated a vehicle and a fierce gun battle followed in one of the deadliest attacks in Kabul for years.
A Taliban spokesman said the group carried out the attack.
It came a week after it said it was launching its ""spring offensive"", warning of large-scale attacks, although the group fights all year round.
Why are the Taliban resurgent in Afghanistan?
Tuesday's bombing happened during the morning rush hour in Pul-e-Mahmud, a busy neighbourhood where homes, mosques, schools and businesses nestle close to the ministry of defence, other ministries and military compounds.
The blast shattered windows up to 1.6km (one mile) away. A police officer told the Associated Press it was one of the most powerful explosions he had ever heard, and he could not see or hear anything for 20 minutes after.
It appears the initial blast cleared the way for Taliban fighters to enter the area - a commonly used tactic.
It had previously been reported that at least 28 people had been killed and 329 injured.
Mr Sediqqi told reporters that most of the 64 now reported dead were civilians. He said most of the wounded were in a stable condition.
At least 71 Shia worshippers were killed in 2011 in a rare attack on a Shia shrine in Kabul.

279,"The number of digital enterprises in Wales jumped by 9.2% last year, says the analysis by law firm Nockolds.
Numbers rose from 3,000 in 2014 to 3,275, although this is below all UK nations and regions except for Northern Ireland and north east England.
The report said cities including Cardiff and Swansea could ""flourish"" because of comparatively low rents.
The number of digital businesses in London rose by 11.6% - from 37,575 to 41,940 during the same period.
Digital businesses range from software and app development to IT consultancy.
According to Nockolds, Wales has emerged as one of the fastest growing UK nations or regions in recent years, with the digital economy a key driver of growth.
The report said the surge in new business creation in the tech sector in Cardiff was fuelling a jobs boom, which is ""rippling out"" to the wider south Wales region.
The Welsh Government estimates there are currently more than 600 firms in the IT sector alone, employing an estimated 30,000 people - around 3.5% of the Welsh workforce.
Meanwhile, there are ambitious plans in the Swansea Bay City Region, aiming to create up to 33,000 jobs over the next 20 years along an ""internet coast"".
Nicola Lucas, a solicitor at Nockolds, said the growth of the digital economy was ""reasonably well distributed"" throughout the UK.
""Cardiff is particularly attractive for financial technology start-ups,"" she said.
""The growth of the financial sector in Cardiff, which has benefited from the relocation of back and middle office functions post-financial crisis, is providing fertile ground for fintech [financial technology] businesses who have a significant market on their doorstep, along with an appropriately skilled workforce.""
She added that rail network improvements would improve access while office rents in Cardiff were typically less than half that of London.
""The only concern is whether Wales can provide the funding environment to hold onto start-ups once they reach a certain scale, or whether these businesses will focus expansion in other regions, such as London,"" said Ms Lucas.
Warren Fauvel, founder of digital health business Nudjed and part of Cardiff Start, a collective of business start-ups, said there were lots of positive signs for the sector in Wales.
""It's a really exciting time for us in Cardiff, Swansea and across Wales and these figures back up what we probably know as a community is starting to happen,"" he said.
""But one of the key things to emphasise is it has to be supported by a consistent strategy that looks across the decades and not just at figures right now.""
He said the digital economy was a great way for Wales to have international businesses again after the decline of traditional industry.
Mr Fauvel, who was brought up in Rhondda, said there needed to be good literacy, numeracy and science education to help Welsh people see beyond the valleys and cities they live in.
""We need continued support from government, local authorities and we need an education system that produces students with good core skills - it's not the most exciting message, but it very much comes down to the people,"" he said.","Wales has the fastest growing digital economy outside London, according to a report on the sector.",37010376

The ""thing"" in question is Google Glass, which I'm wearing in a project with two aims. Firstly, I want to assess just how likely it is that this device, which puts smartphone capabilities in a screen in front of your right eye, will become the standard bearer for the nascent wearable tech industry. And secondly, like other news organisations, we are trying to work out whether Google Glass might prove to be a useful new tool in our journalism.
It's the device's video filming capabilities that are of particular interest to me. Some reporters have already used Glass to film in difficult circumstances, such as riots and demonstrations.  We're wondering whether it might be possible to live-stream the presenter's eye view during our weekly World Service radio programme Tech Tent. (So far, that's looking tricky, but we will persevere.)
And a colleague who writes for the BBC's disability blog Ouch wants to investigate whether Glass could be used by people with visual impairment. Could you for instance make a video call to a friend with better sight to show them what Glass was seeing?
So far, I'm intrigued by the possibilities that Glass offers, but not convinced that the the user interface is up to scratch. Learning to make my way efficiently through the menus by stroking and tapping the side of the frame has proved tricky. For a while I thought I'd mastered lifting my head to turn the device on, and winking to take a picture - but then both somehow stopped working.
Then I was foolhardy enough to wear Glass for a run early this morning with my dog. Taking pictures was relatively simple, but when a message popped up telling me about a friend's birthday I hit trouble. While trying to dismiss the message, I suddenly found I was calling her in the US - where it was the middle of the night.
As for the look of the device, that obviously leaves something to be desired, but apart from the derision of family and colleagues, I've yet to experience either the curiosity or the outright hostility that some American users have reported when they wear Glass in public places. Perhaps the British are just more tolerant of bizarre public behaviour.
Some people have worried about information overload, but I have not found the device intrusive. Although it sends me tweets, emails and news alerts,  I have to choose to look at them. In fact, I'm looking for more, not less, from this gadget, still trying to work out what the ""killer app"" might be.
Still, it is early days. There is all sorts of software under development for Google Glass - from a recipe app that suggests what you can make from ingredients you see in the supermarket to a translator which will help you understand what's on the menu when you're abroad. I'm going to try out as much as I can and will report back here on my impressions.",I've started an experiment - and so far it's had mixed reactions.,26940305

282,"Goals from Geoffrey Kondogbia and Dimitar Berbatov put Monaco in control of the last-16 first-leg tie.
Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain gave Arsenal hope, but Yannick Ferreira Carrasco added a third for the visitors.
""It is just not right to give goals away the way we did,"" said Wenger.
""We missed chances and were suicidal defensively.""
Arsenal must now score at least three goals when the sides meet at Stade Louis II on 17 March if they are to avoid exiting at the last-16 stage for the fifth straight season.
No side has lost a European Cup or Champions League first-leg knockout tie at home by two goals and progressed since Ajax in 1969.
Wenger warned Monaco, who conceded just once and scored only four goals in their group, would play on the counter-attack.
But his team were caught on the break early in the second half as Berbatov added to Kondogbia's deflected opener and substitute Ferreira Carrasco netted another breakaway goal in added time.
""On the second and third goals, it was suicide,"" said the Gunners boss. ""It looks like we have lost our nerve and our rationality. The heart took over the head and at this level that doesn't work.
""Mentally we were not sharp enough. We rushed our game. We knew coming back in at half-time it was important not to concede the second goal, but we were too impatient. It was more heart than brain.""
Wenger admitted Monaco's third goal could be decisive: ""The task is massive now. The third goal makes it even more difficult.""
He substituted compatriot Olivier Giroud on the hour mark after he missed the target with six efforts: ""It looked like it was not one of his best days.""
Former Spurs striker Dimitar Berbatov: ""It was a great success. We fought like a team, we scored our chances and it's a great result.
""Probably the only people who believed we could do something good today was the players and the coach. I know how the good players are that we have. They are young players, but they have good quality.
""It is a big step but nothing is over because Arsenal are a very dangerous team. When the next game comes, we will try to prepare and not allow them to score the goals they need to score.""
Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim: ""No-one really thought that this result would have been possible, but we achieved it. However, Arsenal are a great side and we are only halfway through this knockout tie.
""Football is a team game and we know individual players are important. We were able to nullify their threat. We were very organised and, as I said we would, we were also able to attack with a lot of quality.""
Former Arsenal defender Martin Keown on BBC Radio 5 live: ""The team is not professional enough. They get too caught up in the moment.
""It's one thing to identify the problems, but it's another thing to make the necessary changes. Big decisions have got to be made, but Wenger loves every player and treats every player like his son.

283,"Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said his officers often had ""limited options"" in such circumstances.
His comments come after a Met police officer was filmed apparently attacking a car as the driver refused to get out.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission is investigating the incident.
The officer involved and his colleague have since been placed on restricted duties.
Refusing to comment on the specific incident, Sir Bernard said officers must consider the ""gravity"" of an alleged offence and what would happen if a suspect drove away.
At a meeting of London's Police and Crime Committee, he said: ""If you've got a stopped vehicle and you can't get in what are you going to do - sit there all day?
""You've got to do something, so we do our best to get into the vehicle without causing any damage,"" he said, while admitting vehicles were ""occasionally""  damaged.
The commissioner said removing suspects from a stationary car reduced the chances of a subsequent pursuit.
He added: ""One of the things you've got to look at is the gravity of the offence for which you want to arrest that person.""
Asked whether driving offences might constitute a reason for police breaking into a car, he said there were a number of reasons why someone might be banned from driving and a ""simple motoring offence"" may not always be ""as simple as it appears"".
Sir Bernard also discussed the difficulties of police pursuits, following a crash in Penge, south London, last month in which two people died.
He said police drones, able to monitor suspect cars from the sky, might have a ""small part to play"" in the future while his ""ideal scenario"" would be an electronic device that ""slowed down"" pursued cars.","The Metropolitan Police Commissioner has defended officers faced with the ""dilemma"" of suspects who refuse to leave vehicles.",37437469
284,"Brendan Macken's converted try after just 54 seconds set Wasps on their way.
The bulk of a competitive first half was a kicking contest between Rob Miller and Warriors' Jamie Shillcock, who each landed four penalties.
Stand-in fly-half Miller then also converted scrum-half Dan Robson's 45th minute try to give Wasps control.
Relive Wasps' win at Worcester
Worcester remain six points clear of bottom club Bristol, who they now meet in their next Premiership fixture on Boxing Day at Ashton Gate.
Danny Cipriani's late withdrawal with a calf problem left the injury-hit visitors having to take the field deprived of 13 players, as well as their three England international absentees.
They made an electric start to the Midlands derby with Macken's interception try from the halfway line inside the first minute.
But, by half-time, that score was all that separated the two teams as teenager Shillcock matched Miller's kicking from the tee.
Robson's superb solo effort, when he spotted a gap and jinked his way under the posts, took Wasps two converted scores clear.
Warriors, playing for the first time since head coach Carl Hogg was handed sole charge earlier this week, spent a lot of time in the visitors' half after the break.
The closest they came to at least claiming a losing bonus was when loose forward Alafoti Faosiliva crossed the Wasps line, but referee Craig Maxwell-Keys and his team of officials spotted centre Wynand Olivier's forward pass.
Worcester head coach Carl Hogg told BBC Hereford & Worcedster:
""We showed a huge amount of energy and endeavour and for long periods we looked a good rugby side.
""We had plenty of possession, but we looked a little bit frantic at times because of a lack of set-piece security in the line-outs, where we were always under pressure.
""We lacked a bit of accuracy and precision - that clinical accuracy let us down.
""We put Wasps under pressure for long periods, but we didn't convert. With our line-out malfunctioning, it made it very difficult to get a stranglehold on the game.""
Wasps director of rugby Dai Young:
""There were a lot of new faces and boys who had been waiting for opportunities. I am really proud of the effort.
""You don't win anything with 15 or 23 players. It is a whole squad effort. We have a massive injury list at the moment and that is where a squad comes to the fore.
""Rob Miller was outstanding. Danny went down in the last minute of the team run (on Saturday), and Rob had a very good game organising us.
""It was a fantastic win for us. For me, this has to be up there with one of the best wins we've had this year.""

285,"Especially in China.
But after a series of phone calls I meet just such a man, anxious and on edge, but still determined to tell his story.
He is not a criminal, or a dissident, or a government whistle-blower.
In fact his particular misdemeanour would, anywhere else in the world, be considered a cause for pride and joy.
He is hiding, along with the rest of his family, for the simple reason that his wife has just given birth to their third child.
""A third baby is not allowed,"" he tells me, ""so we are renting a home away from our village.
""The local government carries out pregnancy examinations every three months. If we weren't in hiding, they would have forced us to have an abortion.""
One year ago this week, China announced that what had become perhaps the most widely recognised symbol of Communist Party rule - the one-child policy - was to be scrapped.
It has been replaced instead with a new, universal two-child policy that took effect on 1 January this year.
The old policy - introduced in 1979 to tackle what policymakers saw as the impending crisis of overpopulation - is estimated by the government to have prevented up to 400 million births, in part through the now well-documented use of forced abortions and sterilisations.
So it is little wonder that the mere relaxing of the limit on family size, from one child to two, has done little to assuage the fears of those who fall foul of the new rule.
To mark the first anniversary of the announcement, we set out to investigate what the new policy really means in practice.
And what we have discovered suggests that the brutal machinery of enforcement is still in place along with the Chinese state's insistence on the right of control over women's wombs.
In a grey suburb of a non-descript city in eastern China, I walk, uninvited into one of the notorious family planning centres.
It's a cold, gloomy place the like of which can be found in towns and villages the length and breadth of this vast country.
The floor plan at the entrance adds to the sense of unease.
It shows that this shabby, run-down building contains two ultrasound rooms and three operating theatres.
And when I ask one of the senior officials in charge whether those theatres have ever been used to carry out forced abortions, he pauses.
""Very few,"" he finally replies, before going on to insist that none have taken place for ""at least 10 years.""
Where else in the world would you find a government official admitting that his colleagues have kidnapped, drugged and forcibly operated on women, no matter how long ago?
Where else would the qualifier ""very few"" be considered an acceptable alternative to an outright denial?
It is an illustration of how the one-child policy has bent and blurred the moral lines and made such state-sponsored violence seem unexceptional.
The official tells me that in his district, under the new two-child policy all women of childbearing age are required to report for two ultrasound examinations every year.
Those found to be pregnant with a third baby ""will be advised accordingly"", he says.
To get a sense of the wider reality, I ask a female colleague to telephone a number of family planning centres at random.
Pretending to be a mother, pregnant with her third baby but wanting to keep it, she asks the officials what her options are.
According to Chinese law the only legal sanction available to the state for a woman violating the family planning laws is a large fine.
And, as all the officials we speak to on the phone make clear, with the change in policy from one to two children, the fine remains firmly in place.
Levied at up to 10 times annual average income, these fines are often enough in themselves to act as a powerful disincentive to continue with the pregnancy.
But our research shows officials going further, engaging in coercive home visits with the aim of ""persuading"" women to have abortions.
""If you're reported to us, then we'll find you and we'll persuade you not to give birth to that baby,"" one said.
""We'll definitely find you and persuade you to do an abortion,"" said another.
When asked whether our hypothetical mother might actually face physical force, rather than just heavy persuasion, one official said it was still possible ""in principle"".
Another, in answer to the same question, said: ""It's hard to say.""
And when asked if a woman could just have the baby and pay the fine yet another official answered: ""No. You just can't.""
China's one-child policy was scrapped, not out of the recognition that a woman should be free to choose what she does with her own body and her own fertility, but because the Communist Party finally woke up to the economic consequences of the falling birth rate.
The irony is that the two-child policy is too little too late - not enough women are choosing to have even a second baby.
Small families have become the social norm.
That means of course that the pool of people wanting a third child will be even smaller again and some officials we spoke to seemed relatively indifferent, perhaps resigned to their diminishing power in the face of such arithmetic.
""If you want to give birth to your baby, just go ahead,"" one said, although he was still at pains to stress that the fine would have to be paid.
Our survey is not scientific of course, but it does offer a glimpse into a system that remains rigid and dogmatic.
We found no evidence, no admission, of a forced abortion being carried out since the introduction of the two-child policy, but the threat is clearly still there.
The family in hiding, having escaped that threat, now face a large fine following the birth of their third baby.
""We don't have the money for the fine. We just don't know what to do,"" the father tells me.
But does he regret it?

But under the Centre Court roof, Williams was supreme, winning eight games on the trot to secure victory.
From trailing 3-1, two-time Grand Slam champion Kuznetsova twice broke Williams' serve for a chance to serve for the set, but the defending champion immediately broke back to level at 5-5 before play was suspended because of light rain.
When the players returned to the court the roof had been closed and the indoor conditions favoured Williams' big serve, with Kuznetsova failing to win a game as the world number one confidently secured the first set and, without further loss of a game, the match.

When the match resumed the American confidently wrapped up the tie-break and then broke her opponent's serve in the third game of the second set.

The government planned to give Girl Effect, the organisation which created Yegna, Â£11.8m between 2015 and 2018.
Girl Effect said its aims had been ""wilfully misrepresented"" in the media.
The organisation was created by the Nike Foundation and given funding by the UK's Department for International Development (DfID) to help promote women's rights in developing countries. It used some of its funding to create and promote Yegna.
The band, dubbed ""Ethiopia's Spice Girls"", has been the subject of a long-running campaign by the Daily Mail, which claims grants to the group were a waste of money.
Girl Effect founded the five-strong girl band in 2013 to tackle issues including domestic violence and forced marriage through songs and online videos.
The DfID said its partnership with Girl Effect has ended following the review, but insisted that ""empowering women and girls around the world remains a priority"".

The president denies the allegations, with the government calling the probe an ""anti-democratic attack"".

""The selected team has a nice blend of youth and experience, and the whole squad has been working really hard to get to this point.
""The team is in a good place and we're looking forward to completing our preparation in South Africa next week.""
The Irish go into the tournament as the fifth highest ranked side, indicating that a World Cup qualification spot is very much in reach.
The Green Machine face hosts South Africa in their opening game on 9 July while a trickier task awaits in the second fixture against world number five Belgium two days later.
Egypt follow after that before the pool stages conclude with a 15 July match against Germany, a side Ireland defeated 4-2 on Sunday to win the Hamburg Masters.

293,"It has been introduced in two districts - Lisburn and Castlereagh, and Ards and North Down.
Police said research showed up to 85% of drive-offs are ""genuine mistakes"" that do not require their input.
Now, petrol station retailers will be responsible for tracing drivers who do not pay.
Letters were sent to petrol stations in the two districts in July explaining the change, which came into effect at the start of August.
David Cardwell, who runs a petrol station in Portavogie, County Down, said police were ""washing their hands"" of the issue.
The new process means retailers will ""have to send a letter to the Driver Vehicle and Licensing Agency (DVLA) to get the information on the car, which is a £2.50 fee and tell them that there's been a criminal act"", he said.
Retailers will then have to write to the driver to ask them if they were in the petrol station on a certain date and to ask them to pay for the fuel, added Mr Cardwell.
The new system means if the person responsible does not pay up, retailers will have to take civil action through the courts, he said.
""They (the PSNI) are not giving us any back-up at all with it, they said they haven't got the manpower to address it,"" added Mr Cardwell.
""If someone drives off with £10 of fuel then we have to add £2.50 onto it. It's not worth chasing someone up for that, we'll probably just have to write it off.""
DUP councillor for Ards and North Down, Robert Adair, said the scheme was a ""free for all"" that would lead to an increase in the number of people driving off without paying.
""It's the wrong approach for the police, they're basically asking petrol stations to do the job for the police,"" he said.
""I am asking the PSNI to withdraw the scheme until there's consultation with the local business community here, because we have solutions and a way forward that could resolve this.""
The PSNI said that in the vast majority of such cases, their role was to help petrol stations recover civil debts, which was placing a ""substantial but preventable burden"" on police resources.
""The purpose of this pilot is to remove much of that burden and free up local police time to deal with criminality, identify and apprehend offenders and keep people safe,"" said a police statement.
The scheme would be subject to an ""ongoing review"" to assess the impact on policing in the districts where it is being piloted, said the PSNI.",A new PSNI pilot scheme to deal with people who leave petrol stations without paying for their fuel is facing criticism.,37041264
294,"Francois Hollande said 1,500 unaccompanied minors who were still in the port city would be taken to accommodation centres very shortly.
Migrants fleeing war and poverty had used the sprawling Jungle site as a staging post to try and reach the UK.
The UK has so far agreed to take in about 250 of the children from there.
A government spokesperson said the UK remained ""firmly committed to working with the French to safeguard and protect children who remain in Calais - and that includes transferring eligible children to the UK safely and as soon as possible"".
The Jungle had been seen as a key symbol of Europe's failure to deal with the worst migrant crisis since World War Two.
At least 1,500 minors have been staying at a special container camp at the site, but it has been full and many children have also reportedly been sleeping rough.
Mr Hollande said he and UK Prime Minister Theresa May had discussed British officials processing them in France with a view to rehousing them in the UK.
""I talked yesterday [Friday] with the British prime minister, as [French Interior Minister] Bernard Cazeneuve did with his British counterpart, so that the British can go to those centres with those minors and take their share to welcome them in Britain,"" he said.
Mr Hollande was speaking during a visit to an accommodation centre for migrants in Doue-la-Fontaine in western France.
He hailed the evacuation of the Calais Jungle as a success.
""There were no incidents from start to finish,"" Mr Hollande said. ""We had to rise to the challenge of the refugee issue. We could not tolerate the camp and we will not tolerate any others.""
He added the encampments springing up in the capital Paris would be forced to close.
Many of the 5,000 people evacuated from the Jungle have been taken to reception centres around France, where they are being processed and will be able to apply for asylum.
But aid workers believe that hundreds, or perhaps even thousands of migrants, might have fled the area before the clearance operation began last Monday.
Demolition work is continuing and the local authorities say the clearance will be completed by Monday.

295,"Paratrooper Ben Parkinson, from Doncaster, had both legs amputated and was left brain damaged after the landmine blast in 2006.
Not expected to survive, he was flown to the UK to die close to his family.
But Ben defied the odds and his latest challenge is another astonishing achievement in his story of survival.
Rewind the clock nine years and Lance Bombardier Parkinson's life was in a desperate state.
He was just 22 and in a coma with almost 40 separate injuries. The future looked bleak.
But he began the long slow road to recovery that has seen him learn to talk again and take the first faltering steps on prosthetic legs. His long-term ambition is to walk unaided without the use of crutches.
He is now one of Britain's best known wounded soldiers and an inspiration to many.
In 2012, thousands of people watched Ben carry the Olympic Torch through his hometown of Doncaster and a year later he was made an MBE.
I first met Ben a few months ago on an open water training weekend on the South Coast of England.
I was joining him on the trip to the Yukon and within minutes I was struck by his sheer determination and wicked sense of humour.
As someone who reports on wildlife for The One Show I was looking forward to an encounter with some bears or wolves. Pointing at my legs, Ben told me I was more of a target for grizzly bears because there was more ""meat on me"".
The expedition to the Yukon was organised by a charity for severely wounded soldiers known as the Pilgrim Bandits. They are a group of former servicemen who are using their skills to help people such as Ben rediscover the military lives they once enjoyed.
Mike Witt, from the charity, told me: ""When we first met Ben he was in an electric wheelchair. He could hardly talk. He looked a real sad bloke.
""But you could see Ben's a special guy. You could see somewhere there was still something wanting to get out and able to get out. And it just needed the nut cracking really, and that's all we've done.""
On paper it was daunting trip for all of us but especially for Ben and a couple of other military amputees who were also there.
Not only was there the distance we were going to cover but also the sheer remoteness of the location. In essence, if anything went wrong, we were a long way from help.
Yukon territory is twice the size of Britain but with a population of just 35,000.
The Yukon River flows for more than 2,000 miles and is one of the biggest river systems in North America.
It is fast flowing and fed by glacial melt water and as a result the temperature is just above freezing. Falling into such cold swift moving water was not an enticing option.
Each night Ben, myself and the rest of the Pilgrim Bandits team were wild camping. For the amputees this was the toughest part. Just getting in and out of the boats and moving around camp required massive effort.
But Ben has spent years training for a moment like this and, being a gym fanatic, he has amazing upper body strength. We all thought the canoeing was going to be the least of his problems.
But three days into the expedition it became clear he was struggling with a long-term injury.
The explosion in Afghanistan had left him with a broken back and at one point he was forced to swap his canoe for my kayak so he could complete the expedition in less pain.
Ben was helped on the trip by his stepdad Andy Dernie who paddled the full 250 miles. Andy and Ben's mum Diane have sacrificed everything to get Ben to this point in his life. They are his full time carers and their home in South Yorkshire is Ben's rehabilitation centre.
Diane said: ""There was always something special about what Ben did. We were incredibly proud of his achievements, but nothing even compares to how proud we are of the way he's coped with what's happened to him.""
Ben Parkinson: Wilderness Warrior will be broadcast on BBC1 at 15:15 GMT on Sunday, 22 November.","Nine years after being blown up in Afghanistan, one of the British Army's most wounded soldiers has kayaked 250 miles down Canada's mighty Yukon River.",34872481
296,"League One champions Rangers and relegated Edinburgh pair Hearts and Hibernian will start as favourites as 10 clubs chase just one automatic promotion spot and the two below that lead to a play-off.
New Hibs manager Alan Stubbs' rebuilding job started late as he inherited a squad culled after last season's relegation and has initially looked south of the Border to capture striker Farid El Alagui, midfielder Scott Allan, defender David Gray and goalkeeper Mark Oxley.
Under their own new management of Robbie Neilson as head coach and overlord Craig Levein, Hearts have instigated the biggest turnaround of playing staff in the Championship so far.
While the likes of former Sparta Rotterdam forward Soufian El Hassnaoui and ex-Trabzonspor defender Alim Ozturk are intriguing arrivals, the real headline grabbers have been at Ibrox.
Having won the two leagues below at a canter after their own insolvency event, this is the real test for Rangers and, despite continuing question marks about their finances, they have resurrected the Scotland strike pairing of Kris Boyd and Kenny Miller that served them well in the top flight, albeit now with older legs.
Of the others, Falkirk have picked up the gauntlet under their new manager, Peter Houston, and a young squad that missed out in last season's play-offs has been bolstered by the addition of four players who featured in the Premiership last season.
Key signing: Having spent time with Celtic, Hamilton Accies and Raith Rovers, 22-year-old striker Greig Spence has returned to Alloa and four goals in two cup games have already suggested he can replace Ross Caldwell, who led the line at the tail end of last season on loan from Hibernian.
One that got away: Former Scotland forward Derek Riordan failed to make an impact during his short-term deal and the 31-year-old has drifted off into the football wilderness, his football career a tale of unfulfilled talent.
Last season:8th
Prediction: 9th. Alloa are one of three part-time clubs in the Championship and, as such, are likely to be involved in a scrap at the bottom to avoid relegation.
In: Greig Spence, forward (Raith Rovers); Liam Buchanan, forward (East Fife); Adam Asghar, midfielder (Motherwell); Mark Docherty, defender (Stranraer); David Weatherston, forward (Stirling Albion); John Gibson, goalkeeper (Dundee). Loan: Kyle Benedictus, defender (Dundee).
Out: Scott Bain, goalkeeper (Dundee); James Creaney, defender (Stirling Albion); Darren Young, midfielder (Albion Rovers); Derek Riordan, forward; Andy Kirk, forward; Willie Robertson, midfielder (Stirling Albion); Iain Flannigan, midfielder. Loan ended: Ross Caldwell, forward (Hibernian); Liam Lindsay, defender (Partick Thistle); Liam Caddis, midfielder (St Johnstone).
Key signing: Danijel Jurisic, 25, capped at youth level with Slovenia and previously of Austrian club Lannach, is one of three strikers brought in by Jimmy Nicholl in the hope of finding a replacement for departed duo Kane Hemmings and Greg Stewart.
One that got away: Kane Hemmings' 24 goals in 39 appearances for a side struggling against relegation led to the former Rangers youth winning a move to Barnsley.
Last season: 9th
Prediction: 10th. Jimmy Nicholl worked wonders to first avoid automatic relegation then win a play-off against Dunfermline Athletic, but the Blue Brazil's part-time status guarantees another struggle.
In: Robbie Thomson, goalkeeper (Rochdale); Danijel Jurisic, forward (Lannach); Craig Sutherland, forward (Queen's Park); Darren Brownlie, defender (Partick Thistle); Iain Campbell, defender (Forfar Athletic); Sean Higgins, forward (Stenhousemuir); Pat Scullion, midfielder (Clyde); Anthony Higgins, forward (Airdrieonians). Loan : Kudus Oyenuga, forward (Dundee United); Marcus Fraser, defender (Celtic); Calum Gallagher, forward (Rangers); Declan Hughes, midfielder (St Mirren).
Out: Kane Hemmings, forward (Barnsley); Greg Stewart, forward (Dundee); Jamie Stevenson, midfielder (Peterhead); Marc McKenzie, forward (Albion Rovers); Seb Usai, goalkeeper; Jamie Pyper, midfielder. Loan ended: James Fowler, defender (Kilmarnock); Rory McKeown, defender (Kilmarnock); David Gold, midfielder (Hibernian); Darren Brownlie, defender (Partick Thistle).
Key signing: Lee Mair, ex of Partick Thistle, along with former St Mirren team-mate David van Zanten, will add experience to the Sons defence.
One that got away: Paul McGinn was tipped for bigger things when he joined St Mirren but has been given a second chance in Scotland's top flight after the 23-year-old full-back joined promoted Dundee.
Last season: 5th
Prediction: 7th. Dumbarton punched above their weight last season, but finances will dictate more than ever in the Championship this time round, although Ian Murray's side are likely to finish at least the best of the three part-time outfits.
In: Guillame Beuzelin, assistant manager; David Van Zanten, defender (St Mirren); Lee Mair, defender (Partick Thistle); Archie Campbell, forward (Greenock Morton); Scott Taggart, midfielder (Greenock Morton). Loan: Danny Rogers, goalkeeper (Aberdeen); Chris Kane, forward (St Johnstone); Kieran MacDonald, defender (Hamilton Academical).
Out: Jack Ross, assistant manager (Hearts); Paul McGinn, defender (Dundee); Bryan Prunty, forward (Airdrieonians); Scott Smith, defender (East Fife); Kevin Smith, forward (East Fife); Martin McNiff, defender (Annan Athletic); Alan Deans, defender (East Stirlingshire); Nicky Phinn, midfielder; Owen Ronald, midfielder. Loan ended: Michael Miller, midfielder (Celtic); Callum Thomson, defender (St Mirren); Chris Kane, forward (St Johnstone).
Key signing: Jamie MacDonald's heroics delayed Hearts' inevitable relegation last season and the 28-year-old goalkeeper's capture is a major coup for new Falkirk manager Peter Houston.
One that got away: Falkirk accepted the inevitable as Scotland Under-19 full-back Stephen Kingsley left for Swansea City - but not without a transfer fee for the 20-year-old.
Last season: 3rd
Prediction: 4th. The Bairns appear to be the only side capable of getting in amongst the financial giants of Hearts, Hibs and Rangers, but their ability to mount a play-off challenge may depend on whether they can avoid losing any more of their talented youngsters to potential suitors.
In: Peter Houston, manager (Celtic); Alan Maybury, defender-coach (Hibernian); Jamie MacDonald, goalkeeper (Hearts); Tom Taiwo, midfielder (Hibernian); Alex Cooper, midfielder (Ross County); Peter Grant, midfielder (Peterborough United); David Smith, midfielder (Hearts), Owain Tudur Jones (Hibernian). Loan: Joe Shaughnessy, defender (Aberdeen).
Out: Gary Holt, manager (Norwich City); Stevie Crawford, assistant manager (Hearts); Stephen Kingsley, defender (Swansea City, undisclosed); Conor McGrandles, midfielder (Norwich City, undisclosed); Michael McGovern, goalkeeper (Hamilton Academical); Johnny Flynn, defender, (Cliftonville); Steven Brisbane, midfielder (East Stirlingshire); Connor Greene, defender (East Stirlingshire); Kris Faulds, midfielder; Kyle Turnbull, defender. Loan ended: Mark Miller, midfielder (St Johnstone); Joe Chalmers, defender (Celtic); Mark Beck, forward (Carlisle United).
Key signing: Hearts' new owners and management team have made so many impressive signings and re-uniting former Tannadice duo Morgaro Gomis and Prince Buaben will give them a creative midfield base. Turkey Under-21 cap Alim Ozturk could form a formidable central defence alongside Danny Wilson, but Swedish striker Osman Sow could prove to be their most astute addition.
One that got away: Jamie MacDonald was a victim of the club's financial cull despite being the stand-out performer as Hearts were relegated last season, but former Scotland goalkeeper Neil Alexander is a more-than-able replacement.
Last season: 12th, Premiership
Prediction: 1st. Hearts may well have avoided relegation last season had it not been for a 15-point deduction for being in administration. Their new management team appear to have added good experience to the young talent that emerged last term and have the ability to edge out Rangers and Hibs for the title.
In: Craig Levein, director of football; Robbie Neilson, head coach (East Fife); Stevie Crawford, assistant head coach (Falkirk); Morgaro Gomis, midfielder (Dundee United); Prince Buaben, midfielder (Carlisle United); Adam Eckersley, defender (AGF Aarhus); Soufian El Hassnaoui, forward (Sparta Rotterdam); Alim Ozturk, defender (Trabzonspor); Neil Alexander, goalkeeper-coach (Crystal Palace); Osman Sow, forward (Crystal Palace); James Keatings, forward (Hamilton Academical); Liam Henderson, defender (Hutchison Vale); Alistair Roy, forward (Stirling Albion); Lee Hollis, goalkeeper (Motherwell); Miguel Pallardo, midfielder (Levante).
Out: Gary Locke, manager; Billy Brown, assistant manager; Alan Combe, goalkeeper/coach (Hibernian); Ryan Stevenson, midfielder (Partick Thistle); Jamie Hamill, midfielder (Kilmarnock); Jamie MacDonald, goalkeeper (Falkirk); Mark Ridgers, goalkeeper (St Mirren); David Smith, midfielder (Falkirk); Dylan McGowan, defender (Adelaide United); Callum Tapping, midfielder (Brechin City); Jack Simpson, midfielder (Hamilton Academical); Kai Wilson, defender (Berwick Rangers). Loan: Gary Oliver, forward (Stenhousemuir); Liam Smith, defender (East Fife). Loan ended: Paul McCallum, forward (West Ham United).
Key signing: Farid El Alagui has proved his goalscoring prowess at this level previously with Falkirk before heading for Brentford and the 28-year-old French striker faces the challenge of doing the same again in a league bolstered by Hearts and Rangers, while former Hearts and Manchester United trainee David Gray looks like a find at right-back.
One that got away: A whole squad of players were ditched from Easter Road along with Terry Butcher and his management team, and none had performed sufficiently well for Hibs fans to lament their exits.
Last season: 11th, Premiership.
Prediction: 3rd. Hibs looked physically stronger and a better footballing side than Rangers despite their League Cup exit in their first competitive outing under new manager Alan Stubbs, but a lack of squad depth might hamper their title chances.
In: Alan Stubbs, manager (Everton); Andy Holden, assistant manager; John Doolan, first-team coach (Wigan Athletic); Alan Combe, goalkeeper/coach (Hearts); Scott Allan, midfielder (West Bromwich Albion); Farid El Alagui, forward (Brentford); David Gray, defender (Burton Albion); Liam Fontaine, defender (Bristol City), Dominique Malonga, forward (Cesena). Loan: Mark Oxley, goalkeeper (Hull City); Matthew Kennedy, midfielder (Everton); Dylan McGeouch, midfielder (Celtic); Jake Sinclair, forward (Southampton).
Out: Terry Butcher, manager; James Collins, forward (Shrewsbury Town, undisclosed); Owain Tudur Jones, midfielder; Kevin Thomson, midfielder (Dundee); James McPake, defender (Dundee); Paul Cairney, midfielder (Kilmarnock); Ross Caldwell, forward (St Mirren); Ryan McGivern, defender (Port Vale); Alan Maybury, defender (Falkirk); Tom Taiwo, midfielder (Falkirk); Bradley Donaldson, defender (Livingston); Ryan Baptie, defender (Inverness Caledonian Thistle); Ben Williams, goalkeeper (Bradford City); Paul Grant, goalkeeper (Livingston); Robert Wilson, defender (Airdrieonians); Jay Doyle, forward (East Stirlingshire); Dean Horribine, midfielder (Berwick Rangers); David Gold, midfielder (Berwick Rangers); Euan Bauld, defender (Berwick Rangers); Euan Smith, midfielder (Kilmarnock); Michael Nelson (Cambridge United); Sean Murdoch, goalkeeper, Owain Tudur Jones (Falkirk). Loan ended: Daniel Boateng, defender (Arsenal); Danny Haynes, forward (Notts County); Duncan Watmore, midfielder (Sunderland).
Key signing: Despite the addition of former Raith Rovers man Gary Glen, one-time Hearts trainee and Wales Under-21 cap Rob Ogleby and Jordan White, whose goals helped Stirling Albion win promotion from League Two, 19-year-old Myles Hippolyte, plucked from obscurity with Southall in the Spartans South Midlands League Division One, could be Livi's star striker.
One that got away: Sheffield United raided Livi in search of the next Stefan Scougall and, if 22-year-old Marc McNulty matches the impact of the midfielder, the League One side will have found a £100,000 bargain striker.
Last season: 6th
Prediction: 8th. Livingston might flirt with relegation but should be safe as they settle into a role as a breeding ground of talent.
In: Gary Glen, forward (Ross County); David Robertson, midfielder (Greenock Morton); Declan Gallagher, defender (Dundee); Myles Hippolyte, forward (Southall); Jordan White, forward (Stirling Albion); Rob Ogleby, forward (Wrexham); Bradley Donaldson, defender (Hibernian); Michael McKenna, midfielder (Musselburgh Athletic). Paul Grant, goalkeeper (Hibernian).
Out: Marc McNulty, forward (Sheffield United, undisclosed); Martin Scott, midfielder (Raith Rovers); Andrew Barrowman, forward (Greenock Morton); Kyle Turnbull, defender (Albion Rovers); Michal Habai, defender; Nejc Mevlja, defender; Mike Mampuya, defender; Kyle Wilkie, midfielder; Ross Docherty, midfielder; Jordan Baillie, midfielder; Taylor Black, defender; David Bonnar, midfielder; Dylan Clark, Jed Davie, forward; Jack Downie, midfielder; George Hunter, midfielder; Kyle Martin, midfielder; Scott Wilson, midfielder.
Key signing: Striker John Baird, 28, will hope to continue where he left off last season, when he scored seven goals in 13 games on loan to Raith Rovers from Partick Thistle.
One that got away: Wily assistant manager Gerry McCabe was poached by promoted Dundee before manager Jim McIntyre left for Ross County.
Last season: 5th
Prediction: 5th. The Dumfries side will trouble the top teams on their good days, but another mid-table finish is as good as they can hope for.
In: James Fowler, defender-coach (Kilmarnock); John Baird, forward (Raith Rovers); Lewis Kidd, defender (Celtic). Loan: Zander Clark, goalkeeper (St Johnstone).
Out: Jim McIntyre, manager (Ross County); Gerry McCabe, assistant manager (Dundee); Derek Young, midfielder (Forfar Athletic); Calum Antell, goalkeeper; Scott Hooper, defender; Aidan Smith, forward; Dean Smith, forward. Loan ended: Zander Clark, goalkeeper (St Johnstone); Liam Caddis, midfielder (St Johnstone); Bob McHugh, forward (Motherwell).
Key signing: Winger Ryan Conroy is an experienced campaigner at this level and helped Dundee win the title last season.
One that got away: Having experienced the top flight previously with Dunfermline Athletic, tricky winger Joe Cardle has joined promoted Dundee.
Last season: 7th
Prediction: 6th. Grant Murray's side are likely to concentrate again on avoiding relegation rather than looking far above this season.
In: Christian Nade, forward (Dundee); Ross Perry, defender (Rangers); Mark Stewart, forward (Derry City); Kevin Cuthbert, goalkeeper (Hamilton Academical); Martin Scott, midfielder (Livingston); Ryan Conroy, midfielder (Dundee); Rory McKeown, defender (Kilmarnock); Craig Barr, defender (Airdrieonians). Loan: Barrie McKay, midfielder (Rangers).
Out: Paul Smith, assistant manager; Joe Cardle, midfielder (Ross County); John Baird, forward (Queen of the South); Greig Spence, forward (Alloa Athletic); Gordon Smith, forward (Stirling Albion); Reece Donaldson, defender (Peterhead); Fraser Mullen, defender (East Fife); Billy Vidler, forward (East Stirlingshire); Daniel Tobin, goalkeeper (Stranraer); Jamie Watson, forward. Loan ended: Callum Booth, defender (Hibernian).
Key signing: Fellow Ibrox returnee Kenny Miller is better known worldwide, but Kris Boyd, at 30, is four years younger and will go a long way to helping Rangers win the title if he can match his goalscoring form with Kilmarnock in the Premiership last season.
One that got away: In a rare role reversal, Dundee United managed to poach a promising teenager from Rangers, with midfielder Charlie Telfer heading to Tannadice in return for a compensation fee.
Last season: League One champions.
Prediction: 2nd. Rangers have romped to two titles in a row, but vultures of financial uncertainty continue to encircle Ibrox. This will be a real sustained test for manager Ally McCoist, whose side all too often perform to less than the sum of their parts.
In: Kenny Miller, forward (Vancouver Whitecaps); Kris Boyd, forward (Kilmarnock); Darren McGregor, defender (St Mirren); Marius Zaliukas, defender (Leeds United). Lee Robinson, goalkeeper (Unattached).
Out: Andy Little, forward (Preston North End); Charlie Telfer, midfielder (Dundee United, compensation); Chris Hegarty, defender (Linfield); Ross Perry, defender (Raith Rovers). Loan: Barrie McKay, midfielder (Raith Rovers); Calum Gallagher, forward (Cowdenbeath); Robbie Crawford, midfielder (Greenock Morton); Kyle McAusland, defender (Brechin City); Luca Gasparotto, defender (Airdrieonians); Tom Walsh, midfielder (Stenhousemuir); Danny Stoney, midfielder (Stranraer); Craig Halkett, defender (Clyde).",Big-club implosions mean attention this coming season will be on the second tier of Scottish football like never before.,27793738

Charity Birds of Poole Harbour said the eggs -  considered a delicacy - were likely to used by  restaurants.
The nesting gulls are being monitored by Dorset Police's marine unit.
The force said the birds would be checked day and night by officers through the breeding season.

Mr Blackford said it was an ""honour and a privilege to be elected to lead the SNP's strong and talented team of MPs during such a crucial period"".
The new group leader will get to quiz Theresa May every week at Prime Minister's Questions, making it a high-profile role.
Two other SNP MPs, Joanna Cherry and Drew Hendy, contested the Westminster leader position. A fourth candidate, Edinburgh East MP Tommy Sheppard, withdrew from the contest on Tuesday, saying it was clear he did not have enough support to win.
Party leader Nicola Sturgeon said she was ""delighted"" to see Mr Blackford elected.
She added: ""Ian has formidable professional and political experience and has played a key role in the last two years as part of the effective opposition to the Tory government.
""Ian has led our work opposing Tory benefit cuts, and supporting the WASPI women - supporting vulnerable people across the country in the face of callous Tory policies.""
A former investment banker, Mr Blackford was the party's treasurer before falling out with then-leader Alex Salmond, which resulted in him being suspended by the party in June 2000.
But it was announced in 2015 that Mr Blackford would be the SNP's candidate in Ross, Skye and Lochaber in that year's general election, which saw him defeat former Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy.
He went on to hold the seat in last Thursday's election with a majority of nearly 6,000 over the Conservatives - the second largest enjoyed by any SNP MP.
Mr Robertson, who is also the SNP's deputy leader, had won widespread praise for his performance at PMQs, with many political opponents commending his forensic questioning of the prime minister.

Favreau was behind this year's new version of The Jungle Book, featuring a mix of animation and live action.
He has tweeted that he is ""excited"" for his ""next project"", using emojis of a lion and a crown.
Disney said the new version would feature hit songs from the 1994 film, which were written by Sir Elton John, Sir Tim Rice and Hans Zimmer and included Circle of Life, Hakuna Matata and Can You Feel the Love Tonight.

The finger of blame was initially laid upon Mr Berlusconi's friend Col Muammar Gaddafi, with allegations of parties hosted by the Libyan leader involving ""harems"" of young Western women.
Then stories circulated claiming the phrase owed its origins to a bawdy joke, which Mr Berlusconi claimed was one of his favourites.
Then this week Sabina Began, German actress and friend of the Italian prime minister, told Sky Italia that she herself was bunga bunga.
""'Bunga bunga' is simply my nickname,"" the 36-year-old said.
It's a credible-sounding explanation: ""Began"" and ""Bunga"" are not so different, and the repetition gives it a more informal, nickname-like quality.
""Everyone thinks: 'My God! What does that mean?"" she is quoted as saying. Ms Began went on to explain that it was she who had organised the parties for Mr Berlusconi.
The phrase ""bunga bunga"", is having a global impact, says Paul JJ Payack, president of The Global Language Monitor in the US.
""One of our databases that searches the top global media found almost 800 stories spread across the world.
""Since Mr Berlusconi was reported as saying that he learned harem-style rituals frοm hіѕ friend, Col Gaddafi, the phrase has been reported in Arabic-language news stories.
""On our Chinese search engines there were over 2000 references to news stories in Chinese.
""Finally, we found thousands of references in Russian.
""Will it make the English language lexicon? It certainly seems headed that way. It needs a minimum of 25,000 references with the necessary depth and breadth. It currently has 744,000 references on Google.""

The expression has quickly become part of the Italian vocabulary, says Italian journalist Annalisa Piras, even though no-one really knows what it means.
The theory that it features in Mr Berlusconi's favourite joke is a popular one, she says.
The joke isn't new - it can be found on the internet Urban Dictionary - but in Italy it has been given a political twist. It goes like this:
Two of Mr Berlusconi's political opponents are captured by an African tribe. They are asked whether they would prefer to die or undergo bunga bunga. The first one opts for bunga bunga, and is immediately subjected to a sexual assault by members of the tribe. The second one, who now grasps what ""bunga bunga"" means, says he would prefer to die. To which the chief of the tribe replies: ""Okay, you will die - but before you will have bunga bunga.""
Ms Piras says the term is now well embedded in the Italian language. ""Bunga Bunga City"" refers to  Mr Berlusconi's world, the phrase is a popular twitter hashtag, and it even inspired a song performed on Italian television to the tune of Shakira's Waka Waka World Cup anthem.
In Italy, ""bunga bunga"" is pronounced: BOONG-guh BOONG-guh (-oo as in moon, -ng-g as in finger, -uh as a in ago, stressed syllables in upper case).

The phrase itself is not new. One of the oldest recorded references dates back to 1910 and another African-themed joke.
The infamous Dreadnought hoax was dreamed up by aristocratic joker Horace de Vere Cole, who contacted the British Admiralty pretending to be the Emperor of Abyssinia. He informed officials that he wished to inspect the Home Fleet while on a forthcoming visit to Britain.
After enlisting some friends - artists from the Bloomsbury group, including writer Virginia Woolf - to masquerade as his entourage, he turned up at the navy's state-of-the-art ship, the Dreadnought.
Officials, taken in by the dark stage make-up, false beards and oriental regalia, treated the group to an official civic reception.
They were reported to have cried ""Bunga, bunga!"" while marvelling at the ship. An account of the visit plus a picture were sent to the Daily Mail newspaper - probably by Cole himself.
Virginia Woolf said later that when the real Emperor of Abyssinia arrived in London weeks later, wherever he went, ''the street boys ran after him calling out bunga, bunga!""

The term reappeared at the end of World War I, after HMS Dreadnought sank a German submarine. According to retired Royal Navy captain Jack Broome - in his book Make Another Signal - the congratulatory telegram read: ""BUNGA BUNGA"".
The Dreadnought hoax is certainly not the inspiration for the current use of the phrase - but Mr Berlusconi may intend the phrase to have African connotations, says Tony Thorne, editor of the Dictionary of Contemporary Slang.
""The sound of it is crude and infantile. It is almost like a racist Africanism - some kind of colonial imagined tribal ritual of sexual abandon,"" he says.
""It has a racist, imperialist quality to it - like a phoney African word, like 'wonga'.
""It's so naughty and childish, it goes very nicely with the image that I think Mr Berlusconi wants to cultivate, as comic and absurd.""
Ms Piras says that usage of the phrase in Italy has brought to a new level Mr Berlusconi's image as ""jester-in-chief"".
""He has managed to capture in a slogan the imagination of many of his male compatriots, and the utter contempt of almost every Italian woman.""
The phrase ""bunga bunga"" exists in other languages - in Filipino, it is slang for something ""hot"" or fashionable, in Indonesian it means flowers.
But, for now, it has an association with the Italian prime minister and the current political scandal - or ""bunga bunga-gate"", if you will.","The phrase ""bunga bunga"" has become inextricably linked with the private life of Italy's Silvio Berlusconi, and for those who have puzzled over its origins an intriguing new explanation of its meaning has been offered.",12325796

Conchita, whose real name is Tom Neuwirth, won Eurovision with her drag act and has since gone on to champion LGBT rights.
In the past she's said she's not transgender and describes herself as a gay man.
In the past year she's been invited to the United Nations and gave a speech at the European Parliament where she said: ""As I always say, you don't have to love me, but you have to respect that I'm here.""
She says there's still work to be done though.
Speaking at Eurovision's Greatest Hits gig she tells Newsbeat: ""You have to be respectful. Don't ask for respect if you are not respectful.
""It's not depending on your sexuality, your gender or the colour of your skin.
""It should be in the focus to live a respectful life.""
In January Conchita was invited to the Golden Globes.
""I was in the toilet minding my own business and all of a sudden Felicity Huffman turned to me and congratulated me on my win.

He said: ""We'll never know the number, because, even to us, Amazon won't tell us what the viewing figures are.""
Asked how they will know if viewers like the show, Wilman replied: ""We'll get it from Twitter I would imagine.""
He added that TV fans ""are all there [on social media] with their thumbs banging away"".
The Grand Tour, which launches on Amazon Prime on Friday, stars Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond and will be the trio's first show since leaving BBC Two's Top Gear last year.
Wilman said it was a ""blessing"" that the creative team behind the show would not be told the overnight viewing figures.
""You can just make something and never have to be sort of judged by looking for overnights and so on.
""That is quite a liberating thing, that we will just make our show... it's just going to exist out there.""
Do overnight TV ratings matter?
""Over time hopefully millions will watch it, but we've said goodbye to that big figure coming in on a Monday morning,"" he added, referring to the overnight ratings the Top Gear team used to receive the morning after its Sunday night broadcast.
Some press reports have suggested that Amazon have given The Grand Tour a budget of £4m per episode.
But, Wilman said: ""That figure is nonsense. It was reported in the papers and it's stuck there for good now. It's not true. It's lower than that. I'm not going to tell you the figure but it's a good whack.""
Asked whether the budget was higher than the £1m per episode the BBC reportedly spent on Top Gear, Wilman replied: ""It's more than that. Somewhere between £1m and £4m.""
One episode of The Grand Tour will be released per week - unlike many programmes broadcast on streaming platforms which release all their episodes at once for viewers to watch when they wish.
Speaking about the one-per-week release, Wilman said: ""It's a good thing because if it was Breaking Bad or something like that, you've got a plot and you go 'Oh I've got to see the next one'.
""There's no plot in what we do. It's three overgrown idiots doing stuff. There's nothing to make you go 'I've got to watch the next one', so I'm happy there's a gap between each one.""
He added that Amazon had had ""no editorial input"" in the making of The Grand Tour.
""They just left us alone,"" he said. ""The BBC left us alone as well, in the main, editorially. Amazon have done the very same thing.

It marks a return to 147lbs for Brook, who suffered the injury in a defeat to Gennady Golovkin at middleweight.

""He has sparred a big super-middleweight in Jamie Cox who can punch. He got caught once or twice and there were no signs of problems. We can safely draw a line under that injury and write it off,"" he told the 5 live boxing podcast.

Athens Mayor Giorgos Kaminis says a Golden Dawn MP later tried to assault him for banning the gathering.
Golden Dawn, once a fringe movement, is now Greece's fifth-biggest party.
It was staging the handout to celebrate Greek Orthodox Easter, which falls this weekend. At past events, the anti-immigration party asked recipients to show ID cards proving they were Greeks.
Golden Dawn reportedly managed to hand out some food before police moved in, and it later continued the distribution elsewhere in the city.
Mr Kaminis said no party could use the square for such purposes and vowed to prevent ""thuggery"".
The mayor told the BBC that a Golden Dawn MP tried to attack him at a charity centre he was attending later in the day.
Bodyguards managed to restrain MP Giorgos Germenis, he said, although a 12-year-old girl was injured in the process.
Mr Kaminis says he plans to sue the MP over the incident, which was reportedly caught on camera.

The party is defending 75 of Wales' 1,254 council seats, having gained councillors since the 2012 poll.
It is currently part of the Tory-led coalition running Monmouthshire.
The Lib Dems won 72 council seats in Wales five years ago - down from 165 in 2008 - in the first set of national elections held after the party formed a coalition with the Conservatives at Westminster in 2010.
Since 2012, the party has made a net gain of three council seats as a result of by-elections and defections.
But this year's local elections, on 4 May, follow disastrous polls in the previous two years.
In 2015, the Liberal Democrats lost two Welsh seats at the general election, leaving Mr Williams as the party's only Welsh MP from Wales.
In 2016, Kirsty Williams returned to Cardiff Bay as the party's only AM in the May assembly election after four of her colleagues lost their seats.
Soon after, she was appointed to the Labour-led Welsh Government as education secretary.
At the campaign launch on Wednesday, Mr Williams said ""our politics has never been more divided"" following last June's Brexit vote.
""These elections offer people and communities across Wales the opportunity to stand up for decent, tolerant values and for ideas that will make our communities stronger, more open and more prosperous,"" he said.
""We need fresh talent, new ideas and passion in our local county and city halls to get things done.
""No more should communities have to accept the complacency, arrogance and laziness rife in our local councils. We won't accept it.""

310,"A London primary school may issue face-masks to its pupils. The council in Cornwall may take the extreme step of moving people out of houses beside the busiest roads.
Four major cities - Paris, Athens, Mexico City and Madrid - plan to ban all diesels by 2025.
Stuttgart, in Germany, has already decided to block all but the most modern diesels on polluted days.
In India's capital, Delhi, often choked with dangerous air, a jet engine may be deployed in an experimental and desperate attempt to create an updraft to disperse dirty air.
The World Health Organization calculates that as many as 92% of the world's population are exposed to dirty air - but that disguises the fact that many different forms of pollution are involved.
For the rural poor, it is fumes from cooking on wood or dung indoors.
For shanty-dwellers in booming mega-cities, it is a combination of traffic exhaust, soot and construction dust.
In developed countries, it can be a mix of exhaust gas from vehicles and ammonia carried on the wind from the spraying of industrial-scale farms.
In European cities, where people have been encouraged to buy fuel-efficient diesels to help reduce carbon emissions, the hazard is from the harmful gas nitrogen dioxide and tiny specks of pollution known as particulates.
The first step is to understand exactly where the air is polluted and precisely how individuals are affected - and the results can be extremely revealing.
Scientists at the University of Leicester are trialling a portable air monitor to gather precise data at a personal scale.
We watched as volunteer, Logan Eddy, 14, carried the device in a specially adapted backpack that recorded details of the air he was exposed to.
Exactly where he walked was then displayed as lines on an electronic map, the colour of those lines conveying how unhealthy the air was at different points.
It was much worse than WHO guidelines where he had waited to cross a busy junction, strikingly cleaner in a side-street but then almost off the scale in a sheltered spot beside an arcade of shops where a car was parked with its engine idling.
Seeing a graphic display of how pollution can vary so dramatically changed Logan's view of air, and his friends adjusted their behaviour immediately.
""The people who found out have stopped waiting right near the buses after school for their friends,"" he says.
""They've been waitingâ€¦ further away from the buses.
""It's obviously had an impact on them.""
The personal monitor is one of a range of devices being deployed in Leicester to build up a detailed picture of where pollution hotspots form - and when.
In many cases, they can be short-lived, appearing during rush-hours when traffic jams develop.
For Prof Roland Leigh, of Leicester University, understanding precisely where and when vehicles slow to a crawl or stop will help manage the flow of traffic in a way that minimises the impact on the most vulnerable people - the young and the elderly.
""One of the things we can all do is to improve our transport systems so that our congested traffic is not queued up outside of primary schools and old people's homes but instead is queued in other parts of the city where there's going to be less harm,"" he says.
But what about tackling one of the main sources of the problem in the first place, the vehicles spewing out the pollutants?
In Europe, under pressure from regulators, the manufacturers have progressively cleaned up their engines over the past few decades - first to trap carbon monoxide and unburned fuel, then particulates and most recently nitrogen dioxide.
The latest European standard, Euro 6, requires vehicles to emit far less pollution than older models, but trust has inevitably been eroded after the car giant VW was caught cheating - using software that activated the emissions controls only during tests.
At Bath University, engineers use a ""rolling road"" and a robotic ""driver"" to put cars through realistic simulations of how they are normally used, to find out exactly what's released from the exhaust pipe.
They are also working to understand the trade-offs involved in cleaning up an engine.
For example, adding more pollution-trapping devices can add to fuel consumption, which means increased emissions of carbon dioxide, undermining efforts to tackle climate change.
And however good the latest standards, they still leave vast numbers of older vehicles out on the roads.
Hence the idea of a national scrappage scheme - to provide incentives to drivers to switch to a cleaner model.
It's attracting growing support from an unlikely coalition including the Federation of Small Business, London First, Greenpeace and the Licensed Taxi Drivers' Association.
The challenge, as ever, is to find the money to make this happen and to agree who should pay - taxpayers through government incentives or the vehicle owners themselves.
Prof Chris Brace, an automotive engineer of Bath University, says; ""Whichever way you approach it, you are asking people to spend more in taxation or more to buy new vehicles, and we need to decide whether that's something we're comfortable with as a society.""
Some awkward choices lie ahead.
Will the parents of an asthmatic child dig deep in their pockets to switch to a cleaner car?
Will new housing developments include charging points for electric cars?
Will the money saved from a fuel-efficient diesel be seen as worth sacrificing for the sake of better air for everyone?
And bear in mind that these are ""First World"" questions.
In the rapidly growing cities of Africa, and many parts of Asia, there is hardly any monitoring of pollution at all, let alone political will or money to tackle it.

He came into the country on a tourist visa but told immigration officials he was seeking refuge.
Following Friday's ruling, he is expected to be released shortly.
The US Department of Homeland Security opposed Mr Yee's asylum application, but the immigration judge ruled in the teenager's favour.
Judge Samuel Cole released a 13-page decision, which said Mr Yee faced persecution in Singapore for his political opinions.
""Yee has met his burden of showing that he suffered past persecution on account of his political opinion and has a well-founded fear of future persecution in Singapore,"" Judge Coel ruled.
""Accordingly, this court grants his application for asylum.""
Amos Yee is not the only one celebrating his US asylum win - many Singaporeans are pleased as well.
""Finally... hopefully it is the last we have heard of him,"" a Facebook user wrote in one typical comment online.
But some Singaporeans also sympathise with Amos, who has clearly struggled with the country's restrictions. ""It's just his bad luck that he was born in Singapore,"" said another commenter on Facebook.
The teenage critic is one of Singapore's most controversial figures, where he is viewed with exasperation but also a measure of sympathy. Singapore is known for its strict rules on free speech, especially when it comes to race and religion - rules which the US judge said have been used by the authorities to constrain dissent, but which many in the city-state support.
Following Mr Yee's explosive remarks about the country's deeply-revered late leader Lee Kuan Yew and Christianity, Mr Yee had continued to fall foul of the law by breaching bail conditions and making further critical comments about religion.
Even by leaving Singapore he has committed an offence, as he is avoiding mandatory military conscription. While in US detention he had run into trouble for making remarks about Islam, according to his representatives.
But some Singaporeans also empathise with Amos, who has clearly struggled with the country's restrictions. ""Congratulations Amos. He can now lead the free life he wants in the free world. It's just his bad luck that he was born in Singapore,"" said another commenter on Facebook.
Mr Yee's lawyer, Sandra Grossman, said he could be released as early as Monday.
In statement, Ms Grossman applauded the judge's decision and said, ""The right to free speech is sacred, even when such speech is considered offensive.""
In September 2016, the teenager was given a six-week prison sentence in Singapore after being found guilty of ""wounding religious feelings"".
He had posted a video critical of Christianity and Islam.
He was also jailed by a Singapore court for four weeks in 2015, for criticising Christians and for posting  a video about the country's former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew.
His video, posted on YouTube days after his death, compared the widely-respected founding father of Singapore to Jesus Christ.
Later, he posted a crude cartoon depicting Lee Kuan Yew and former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who was one of his allies.

In a statement announcing the plans, Mr Javid said: ""Domestic abuse can happen to anyone, at any time, which is why our £20m fund is designed to ensure no victim is turned away from the essential support they need.
""It will address the needs of diverse and isolated communities and boost refuge spaces, as part of a country that works for everyone and not just the privileged few"".
As well as being the first wave of £40m in support for domestic abuse victims outlined in the 2015 Spending Review, the money is also part of the government's wider £80m Violence Against Women and Girls strategy.

Ordinary Cubans were held behind police lines around the event venue, and many voiced their frustration.
The show is the latest sign in Cuba's warming relations with the West.
Earlier this week, a US cruise ship docked in Havana after sailing from Florida - the first such crossing in more than 50 years.

At the time, Marshall taught at what was Windsor Grammar School, Berkshire, before moving to St Paul's, Barnes.
The court heard the assaults took place in the defendant's car, the victims' homes and abroad.

Japan said it would abide by the decision but added it ""regrets and is deeply disappointed by the decision"".
Australia argued that the programme was commercial whaling in disguise.
The court's decision is considered legally binding.
Japan had argued that the suit brought by Australia was an attempt to impose its cultural norms on Japan.
Reading out the judgement on Monday, Presiding Judge Peter Tomka said the court had decided, by 12 votes to four, that Japan should withdraw all permits and licenses for whaling in the Antarctic and refrain from issuing any new ones.
It said Japan had caught some 3,600 minke whales since its current programme began in 2005, but the scientific output was limited.
Japan signed up to a moratorium on whaling in 1986, but continued whaling in the north and south Pacific under provisions that allowed for scientific research. Norway and Iceland rejected the provision and continued commercial whaling.
The meat from the slaughtered whales is sold commercially in Japan.
Japan has clashed repeatedly with Australia and some other Western countries, which strongly oppose whaling on conservation grounds.
Japan has argued that minke whales and a number of other species are plentiful and that its whaling activities are sustainable.
A spokesman for Greenpeace UK, Willie MacKenzie, welcomed the ICJ's decision.

It is the first such Grameen-style scheme in Western Europe.
Grameen aims to alleviate economic, health and social inequalities in some of Scotland's poorest communities.
The original Grameen bank was founded in Bangladesh in the 1970s by Nobel Prize winner Prof Muhammad Yunus.
Grameen in the UK offers small loans, initially of Â£1,000, for up to 52 weeks to new start-ups and existing small businesses currently not served by any financial services.
The model has been used in developing countries to support entrepreneurship and alleviate poverty, and in many cases to empower women.
However in the UK, currently 60% of Grameen's borrowers are men.
The venture is backed by a number of funders including Tesco Bank.
Grameen in the UK chief executive Kevin Cadman told BBC Scotland the scheme had helped a whole variety of different businesses from hairdressers to markets stalls, from food to clothing retailers.
He said: ""For one reason or another they weren't able to raise money through the normal banking system.
""Our model is based on relationship and trust. I always say it is a bit like what banking was 30 years ago. We don't credit score, we don't do background checks, we don't take security, we lend to the individual and we want to get to know the individual.
""So as the business grows, we will lend more money and we will support that individual in growing their business to generate more income for their family.""
The UK scheme has now secured additional financial backing of Â£250,000 over next three years from the Whole Planet Foundation - part of Whole Foods Group - to fund new client loans.
The Moffat Charitable Trust has also granted Â£45,000 to fund the operational costs of moving services into Ayrshire.

Judges declared the term was ""unduly lenient"".
Lady Justice Rafferty said ""this was a chronicle of cold, callous sexual degradation of four women"", with the youngest a vulnerable 15-year-old.
The judge, sitting in London alongside two others, described the offending as ""grave"" and emphasised the need to impose a sentence to ""deter others"".
Dennis, who watched proceedings via videolink from prison on Wednesday, had been convicted of five counts of rape and three of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.
A four-year extended period on licence imposed by the trial judge remains part of his sentence.

He said he had not broken any rules and there was ""no legal liability"" for him to fill a £571m pension deficit.
But Sir Philip added progress was being made in addressing the black hole.
In a letter to Mr Field, the chairman of the Work and Pensions Select Committee, Sir Philip said the process and timetable for solving the issue had been set by the Pensions Regulator and was ""cumbersome and slow"".
He added: ""If you continue to seek to usurp the Pension Regulator's role with your characteristically unfathomable statements and hurl daily abuse at us, any failure to arrive at a pensions solution will be down to you.""
On Monday, a joint report from the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee and the Work and Pensions Committee suggested Sir Philip, who ran BHS between 2000 and 2015, had extracted large sums from the company and left it on ""life support"".
The report said his failure to resolve BHS's pension deficit was a major factor in its demise and Labour MP Mr Field has used several media interviews since then to say Sir Philip should ""write a cheque"".
Further comments in a radio interview prompted lawyers for Sir Philip to say Mr Field had made a ""highly defamatory and completely false"" statement and demand an apology.
In his letter, Sir Philip said he had tried to stay silent and focus on working towards a solution for the BHS pensioners but was ""not prepared to continue to allow your abuse to go unanswered"".
Sir Philip said: ""Even before the parliamentary inquiry started hearing from witnesses, you turned it into little more than a kangaroo court, with your constant press campaign barracking and insulting me and my family and your announcement from day one that the predetermined result of the inquiry was that I either sign a large cheque or lose my knighthood.""

328,"Parents often fail to apply for the meals for older pupils, says the National Association of Head Teachers.
The NAHT wants MPs to add a clause on auto-registration to a bill being debated on Monday.
Ministers said they did not believe that the proposed amendment was necessary ""at this stage"".
But NAHT general secretary Russell Hobby said it would ensure ""more children get the support they are entitled to"".
Until 2014 families had to apply for their children to have free school meals, which were open only to the most disadvantaged groups.
That year, the coalition government introduced universal free school meals for all children in reception, Year 1 and Year 2.
As all children were eligible, some low-income families stopped informing schools about their circumstances.
The knock-on effect was that once their children reached Year 3, they began to miss out, not only on free meals to which they were entitled, but on extra educational funding linked to being registered for the meals.
The Department for Education website says older children could be eligible for free school meals if their parents receive any of a range of benefits that includes:
But, according to the NAHT, some parents do not realise they need to apply for the free meals once their children reach Year 3 and the universal entitlement runs out.
Some may have poor literacy or English language skills, while others live in chaotic households and are unable to find the organisational focus to fill in the forms.
If adopted, an amendment to the Digital Economy Bill by four opposition MPs would automatically require councils to tell schools which of their pupils lived in low-income households and claimed benefits that indicated they should receive free meals.
Tony Draper, head of Water Hall Primary School in Bletchley near Milton Keynes, says registration rates for the meals there have dropped from 60% in 2014 to 28% this year.
""It's way too low for this area. This is one of the most deprived estates in the country.""
Mr Draper argues that auto-registration would be a massive boost for families who are just about managing, a group the prime minister has said she wants to help.
He says some parents are too proud to admit they are on benefits.
""Auto-registration would take this issue away. It would be easy for the government to do.""
The Pupil Premium, a sum of money paid to schools to enhance the education of children from disadvantaged backgrounds, also depends on pupils being registered for free school meals.
So if fewer parents apply for the meals, the school would get less Pupil Premium money and be less able to plan specialist help for children from low-income families, explained Mr Draper.
If adopted, the new clause ""could deliver much-needed support and money for children and schools"", said Mr Hobby.
The union says it would be an easy change and would show the government's ""true commitment to social mobility"".
A government spokeswoman did not comment directly on the reasons why some parents failed to register their children for free school meals but said: ""The Department for Education already has a tool to enable parents to check for eligibility for free school meals, so we don't believe it's necessary for this amendment to be added to the bill at this stage.""",Head teachers are urging MPs to back a plan to ensure all children from poorer homes in England are automatically registered for free school meals.,38104241

The 47-year-old, of Rokemarsh, pleaded not guilty to a further charge of arson with intent to endanger life.
The prosecution decided not to proceed to trial with the charge at Oxford Crown Court, and it will lie on file.
The estimated cost to the council of repairing damage from the fires on 15 January was about Â£20m, the court heard.
Sentencing, Judge Ian Pringle said: ""We will never know why you picked on the targets you did, but we will always know that the consequences were utterly, utterly devastating.""
At their peak, 27 crews tackled fires in Rokemarsh and Crowmarsh Gifford, which were started within 10 minutes of each other shortly after 03:00 GMT. No-one was hurt.
In the first blaze, Jean Gladstone, 80, escaped from her thatched cottage on Quakers Corner in Rokemarsh.
Minutes later, a second fire was reported at Howard Chadwick Funeral Service in the village of Crowmarsh Gifford.
The third blaze engulfed the council offices.
It was revealed in court Main had mental health issues, most likely a severe bi-polar disorder.
The court was told he intended to kill himself after setting the fires.
He told a psychiatrist he wanted to use a chainsaw to cut his neck.
Prosecutors said CCTV footage from the night showed Main had a chainsaw with him.
He set the fires using gas cylinders, which were found at all three fire sites as well as Main's home.
The burnt-out wreckage of a car that ploughed into the council building moments before it caught fire was found in the foyer.
Main was told he would be detained in the mental health unit for an unlimited period of time.
Det Insp Louise Tompkins, senior investigating officer in the case, said the hospital order reflected ""how unwell Mr Main was at the time he committed the offences"".
""The fires had a significant impact on the local communities in and around Crowmarsh Gifford and Rokemarsh,"" she added.
Adrian Foster, chief crown prosecutor for Thames and Chiltern Crown Prosecution Service said the motives behind Main's ""reckless actions"" remained ""unclear"".
He added: ""Main was assessed by two psychiatric doctors, who both agreed that it would not be possible to make a jury sure that he was capable of forming the requisite intent.
""Therefore, the pleas were accepted by the prosecution team.

333,"Instead, we waste staggering amounts.
So says Professor Per Pinstrup-Andersen, head of an independent panel of experts advising the UN's Food and Agricultural Organization on how to tackle the problem.
Some 40% of all the food produced in the United States is never eaten. In Europe, we throw away 100 million tonnes of food every year.
And yet there are one billion starving people in the world.
The FAO's best guess is that one third of all food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted before it is eaten.
33%
of all food is wasted
$750bn
cost of waste food
28% of farmland grows food that will be thrown away
6-10% of greenhouse gases come from waste food
39% of household food waste is fruit and vegetables
The latest report from the expert panel of the UN Committee on World Food Security concludes that food waste happens for many different reasons in different parts of the world and therefore the solutions have to be local.
Take Chris Pawelski, a fourth generation onion farmer from the US. Mr Pawelski has spent months growing onions in the rich, black soil of Orange County, New York, but the supermarkets he sells to will only accept onions of certain size and look.
""If it's too wet or too dry, the bulbs simply won't make the two-inch size that's required,"" he says.
""There might be imperfections and nicks. There's nothing wrong with that onion. It's fine to eat. But the consumer, according to the grocery store chain, doesn't want that sort of onion.""
In the past, rejected onions would have been sent to rot in a landfill. Now Mr Pawelski works with a local food charity, City Harvest, to redistribute his edible but imperfect-looking onions.
City Harvest says in 2014 it will rescue 46 million pounds - about 21 million kilograms - of food from local farmers, restaurants, grocers and manufacturers for redistribution to urban food programmes.
In rich countries, supermarkets, consumers and the catering industry are responsible for most wasted food. But supermarkets have come under particular pressure to act.
UK supermarket chain Waitrose is attacking food waste in all parts of its business. The upmarket grocery chain cuts prices in order to sell goods that are close to their ""sell by"" date, donates leftovers to charity and sends other food waste to bio-plants for electricity generation. The idea is for Waitrose to earn ""zero landfill"" status.
But then there are consumers like Tara Sherbrooke. A busy, working mother of two young children, she works hard to avoid wasting food but still finds herself throwing some of it away.
""I probably waste about Â£20 worth of food every week,"" she says. ""It's usually half-eaten packets of food that have gone past their 'best before' date.""
In the UK, studies have shown that households throw away about seven million tonnes of food a year, when more than half of it is perfectly good to eat.
Part of the problem is poor shopping habits, but the confusion many consumers have with ""use by"" and ""best before"" food labels is also a factor. ""Use by"" refers to food that becomes unsafe to eat after the date, while ""best before"" is less stringent and refers more to deteriorating quality.
Plus, as Prof Pinstrup-Andersen points out, food in wealthy countries takes up only a relatively small proportion of income and so people can afford to throw food away.
In developing countries, the problem is one not of wealth but of poverty.
In India's soaring temperatures fruit and vegetables do not stay fresh on the market stall for long. Delhi has Asia's largest produce market and it does have a cold storage facility.
But it is not big enough and rotting food is left out in piles. There is not enough investment in better farming techniques, transportation and storage. It means lost income for small farmers and higher prices for poor consumers.
In terms of calories, farmers harvest the equivalent of 4,600 calories of food per person per day. But on average only 2,000 of those calories are actually eaten every day - meaning more than half the calories we produce are lost on their way from farm to dinner fork.
There is enough food for everyone, just a lot of inefficiency, the FAO report concludes.
The environmental impact of all this wasted food is enormous. The amount of land needed to grow all the food wasted in the world each year would be the size of Mexico.
The water used to irrigate wasted crops would be enough for the daily needs of nine million people. And wasted production contributes 10% to the greenhouse gas emissions of developed countries.
Newtown Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant in Brooklyn, New York, is one project trying to reverse that environmental damage. The plant takes food scraps from local schools and restaurants and converts them into energy. Inside towering, silver eggs food waste is mixed with sewage sludge to create usable gas.
The pilot programme is particularly timely. New York City's restaurants will be required to stop sending food waste to landfills in 2015 and will have to turn to operations like these as alternatives.
So progress is being made. Waste food is high on the agenda politically and environmentally.
But there is still much more work to be done. As Prof Pinstrup-Andersen admits: ""We don't really know how much food is being wasted. We just know it's a lot.""","""If food was as expensive as a Ferrari, we would polish it and look after it.""",28092034
334,"The Lionesses led when Ellen White glanced in Isobel Christiansen's cross inside five minutes.
As Christiansen hit the bar after the break, right-back Lucy Bronze followed in the rebound to double the lead.
Captain Steph Houghton then rose highest from a late corner, her header grazing Christiansen before it bounced into the bottom corner to make it 3-0.
Victory was England's second from seven games in 2017 and their first on home soil since a 5-0 win over Estonia in September.
Austria - ranked 24th in the Fifa world rankings, 20 places below England - proved hard for the Lionesses to break down in the first half, but failed to significantly test home keeper Siobhan Chamberlain's reflexes.
England - who missed numerous chances to win during Friday's 1-1 draw with Italy - immediately showed greater composure in front of goal as White lost her marker to turn Christiansen's excellent delivery into the far corner.
They then found themselves up against an Austria keeper in inspired form, as Manuela Zinsberger denied Toni Duggan from close range after the break, having produced a solid low save to prevent a deflection off Nadine Prohaska creeping in for an own goal on 31 minutes.
Bayern Munich keeper Zinsberger also pulled off a superb double save from Christiansen inside the six-yard box, as England's defence were rarely called into action at the other end.
After the introduction of Chelsea forward Karen Carney for her 127th cap, England soon doubled their lead - Bronze darting forward to intercept an Austrian clearance and supply her Manchester City team-mate Christiansen, whose shot hit the bar but fell to Bronze to burst in to beat Zinsberger.
Houghton and Christiansen combined to add a third goal that accurately reflected the Lionesses' dominance in the second half.
With eight of the side that started against Italy once again lining up on Monday, Mark Sampson's preferred XI for the opening game against Scotland at the Euros in July is starting to take shape.
After two solid displays at left-back, Manchester City's Demi Stokes looks now set to remain as the first-choice number three in a back four that includes her City team-mates Houghton and Bronze.
Another energetic performance from midfield should help Jordan Nobbs' cause to be a certain starter in the Netherlands, while fellow midfielder Jade Moore rarely put a foot wrong in a solid, albeit quiet, display.
Christiansen - playing wide on the left in contrast to her usual central role for her club - was busy and involved in all of the home side's goals.
Up front, Birmingham City striker White - returning to the side after missing Friday's game with a slight knock - took her chance to impress Sampson by converting her early opportunity.
Resolute in defence as ever and strong going forward down the right flank, Bronze deserved her fifth goal for England.
Continuing to make a case for being the best right-back in the world, Bronze's class shone again in a performance that was typical of a Champions League semi-finalist. She will remain one of the first names on Sampson's teamsheet.
England boss Mark Sampson: ""Austria's physicality and tactical nous caused us some problems in the first half but without ever threatening our goalkeeper.
""Our performance in the second half was excellent, from one to 11. There was really good balance to our game.
""We were hurt a little bit by our recent record. We felt hard-done by in terms of results.
""It was big to win. It was important. We needed that. We were under a bit of pressure after one win in six. If we want to be the best team in the world, we need to start winning matches consistently.""
England's players will now return to their clubs for the Women's Super League One Spring Series, from 22 April to 3 June, before regrouping again to prepare for this summer's tournament.
Sampson's side will travel to Biel to face Switzerland on 10 June in another friendly and will also play one more away fixture prior to travelling to the Netherlands, with the opponents still to be confirmed.
After a training camp, the Lionesses then face Scotland in their opening game in Group D on 19 July.

Coupland, 48, of Crieff, made two false VAT repayment claims between March 2011 and November 2012.
He claimed his computer had crashed and he had lost vital information which meant his VAT returns ended up being for the wrong amounts.
But the jury found him guilty on two charges of being ""knowingly concerned in the fraudulent evasion of Value Added Tax"".
Coupland was found guilty of submitting false repayment claims for £124,172 between 1 March 2011 and 6 June 2012.
He was also found guilty of submitting a false claim for £37,056 between 1 June and 30 November 2012.
A trial heard that Coupland, sole director of WDR Coupland (Produce) Ltd, aroused suspicion because of the large sums he claimed to have made in net value sales.
HMRC compliance officer Chrystal Symons told the court that she became suspicious about the company when Coupland claimed to have sold over £2m worth of potatoes in two months.
She told the trial: ""You would need to have a large company to be doing that amount of business.""
A raid on Coupland's home and business was carried out to search for the company's records, but he repeatedly avoided meeting investigators.

347,"She was only 21 at the time, but the event helped to inspire the fledgling scientist to crack how the brain is repaired.
The discovery reported today could potentially help millions of people with multiple sclerosis who have a rogue immune system attacking part of the brain.
Dr Fitzgerald's paralysis was caused by a similar condition to multiple sclerosis called transverse myelitis.
Her spinal cord had been stripped of a fatty substance called myelin - a protective coating that allows electrical signals to travel down nerves.
It serves the same function as insulation on an electrical cable. Without myelin, her brain could no longer control her body.
The key difference between the two conditions is transverse myelitis is a one-off event, while multiple sclerosis is a life-long assault on myelin.
Dr Fitzgerald's myelin slowly regenerated and was growing at about the same pace as the hair on your head.
""I asked the doctor 'can you speed this up?' and they said 'not until some bright spark like you comes up with something'.""
She was, eventually, able to make a ""95% recovery"" and even taught herself to walk again.
She told the BBC: ""It shows how much regenerative capacity we have and on my mind was the repair process.
""It was efficient and effective and that led me on to research on MS.""
In multiple sclerosis, the immune system mistakes myelin for a hostile invader and launches an assault.
It can either just get worse, known as primary progressive MS, or come in waves of disease and recovery, known as relapsing remitting MS.
""The reason people have relapsing-remitting is because that natural repair process kicks in,"" Dr Fitzgerald told the BBC.
She is one part of a large research group made up of neuroscientists, immunologists and stem cell scientists that has cracked how the myelin is regenerated.
They hope harnessing this process could lead to new therapies.
Their series of mouse experiments, published in Nature Neuroscience, has unpicked how the body restores myelin (it is the same sequence of events that ultimately restored Dr Fitzgerald's movement).
It starts with a type of white blood cell (called a T-regulatory cell) that is attracted to the damaged myelin in the brain.
Once there it begins to co-ordinate the recovery like a foreman at a construction site.
But rather than bark verbal instructions, the white blood cells do it chemically by using a protein with the technical name of CCN3.
The protein then jolts nearby stem cells into activity.
Stem cells have the rare ability to morph into other cell types and CCN3 tells them to become myelin-manufacturing cells.
Dr Fitzgerald said: ""From my perspective it is a fundamental step forward in the biology of repair.
""Our goal is to eventually use this knowledge to develop drugs to drive the repair of myelin and potentially this could lead to patients regaining function.
""I love my career, but I'd happily be unemployed if we cure multiple sclerosis.""
It is still early days and the next stage of the research will be to perform experiments using human rather than mouse tissues.
""If only I had saved my T-cells from back then, when I was on the hospital bed I should have been saying 'save some of that blood for me',"" she said while musing on a missed opportunity for an experiment.
But even with treatments still on the horizon, the findings ask interesting questions about multiple sclerosis itself.
Why does the repair process get worse with time? Does the disease become more severe and the repair process cannot keep up? Or does age make the repair less efficient?
These will also be considered in the next stage of the research.

348,"Monmouth MP David Davies has backed the idea provided ""benefits and council houses"" are stopped for EU migrants.
Welsh Tory leader Andrew RT Davies has also said free movement would be acceptable with  an overall cap.
Lord Hain said it showed that Brexit campaigners ""sold Leave voters a pup"".
""They were not straight with them. Every person I bumped into on the street believed that Vote Leave would reduce or stop immigration, and Leave campaigners encouraged that belief. It was central to their success,"" he said.
""This is frankly shameless and shameful to renege on the promises that were made.""
Earlier David Davies said the concept of a system continuing ""some sort of freedom of movement"" between the UK and the EU was ""probably right"" if ""benefits and council houses"" were stopped for EU migrants after Brexit
The Vote Leave campaign had called for voters to ""take back control"" of borders, backing an ""Australian-style"" points-based immigration system.
A majority of Welsh voters - as across the UK - backed Brexit in June's referendum, with much of the debate focused on immigration and the EU's system of freedom of movement.
Currently, EU citizens are able to live and work across the 28-member bloc.
Since Leave's success in the poll the nature of the UK's future relationship with the European Union after Brexit, and how immigration would work with remaining EU states, has been subject to debate.
""We can't do anything about immigration from within the EU until we leave,"" the Conservative MP told the BBC's Good Morning Wales radio programme on Thursday.
""Even then I think we are probably going to ensure some sort of freedom of movement for countries already in the EU, and I think that's probably right actually.
But he added: ""I do think we should stop providing benefits and council houses to people who are in the EU.
""I think anyone who comes over here should be expected to work, and it should be clear that they have a responsibility to find that work themselves.
""I think it's wrong we give people from other EU countries the same rights to benefits as someone born and brought up in Britain.""
During the referendum campaign David Davies took part in a BBC Wales debate where he said he was fed up of criticism for raising the issue of immigration.
He claimed that because of EU membership, there was ""uncontrolled migration of mainly young men"" who were coming to the UK ""from a variety of countries looking for a better way of life"".","The head of Labour's Welsh campaign to stay in the EU, Lord Hain, has called two prominent leave campaigners shameless for supporting some freedom of movement between the UK and the EU.",37184103

She allegedly pulled the child killer's hair and repeatedly struck her face and head with the razor.
The alleged attack took place in Riggi's cell, at Cornton Vale Prison, near Stirling, on 19 November 2011.
Riggi, 49, originally from California, United States, who is serving 16 years at the prison, after admitting to stabbing her three young children at their home in west Edinburgh, had to be taken to hospital after the attack.
Hamilton, 40, denied the charge against her and is set to stand trial by jury at Falkirk Sheriff Court next week.
Theresa Riggi killed her three children, eight-year-old twins Austin and Luke, and their sister Cecilia, five, in August 2010, stabbing each of them eight times.
She then allegedly tried to cover up their deaths with a gas explosion, before trying to kill herself by leaping out of their second-floor flat
She had moved to Edinburgh with her children from Skene, Aberdeenshire, following the break-up of her marriage to the children's father, Pasquale Riggi.
The High Court in Edinburgh heard that Riggi had been a protective mother who was involved in a custody battle with her estranged husband over access to the children.
Riggi was originally charged with murder but later admitted culpable homicide on the grounds of diminished responsibility.
Lord Bracadale described the killings as ""truly disturbing"" and ""grotesque"".

Officers believe Mr McGrath was shot after leaving the nearby Sheldon Arms pub a few minutes earlier. Detectives have launched a murder investigation.

Mali's northern desert region has been restive since it was captured by militant Islamists in late 2012.
Despite French military intervention in 2013, the region remains tense.
Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) said the suicide bombing was meant to punish rebel groups co-operating with France, according to a statement obtained by the SITE Intelligence Group.
AQIM said a group called al-Mourabitoun was responsible and named the bomber it said carried out the attack. Malian media had earlier suggested several bombers took part.
The victims were involved in conducting patrols in this highly volatile area under a deal backed by the UN in a bid to stop the violence there.
The accord between the government and rebel groups was signed in June 2015.
Al-Mourabitoun also said it was behind the hostage-taking at the Radisson Blu hotel in the Malian capital, Bamako, in November 2015, and a deadly raid on the Splendid Hotel in the capital of Burkina Faso, Ouagadougou, in January 2016.
It is not the first time the military in Mali has been targeted by a deadly attack.
In July last year, about 17 soldiers were killed and 30 others wounded in an attack on a military base in the central town of Nampala.
Mali's President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita has declared three days of national mourning in a tweet following the latest attack.
The fight against extremist groups is one of the major challenges of Mr Keita's government.
But a new report by Human Rights Watch says the Malian government is not doing enough to protect civilians from the militants.

354,"Areas affected include adult social care and children's services, including children's centres.
The county council said an increase in demand meant it needed to save the extra cash by 2018.
It comes on top of £64m cuts announced last year, when leader Conservative Ian Hudspeth said children's centres were no longer under threat.
Fears that some centres could close sparked protests last year.
A petition signed by David Cameron was presented by about 100 campaigners to the authority in a bid to save the county's 44 centres.
It was later agreed there would be a review to agree how the council could save £3m in 2017.
This latest round of proposed cuts sees the children's services lose an additional £1m next year, and £2m the following year.
However, the authority said there would be ""no immediate reductions in services for many months"".
Mr Hudspeth, said: ""The council is facing unprecedented budget pressures from the rising costs of care and this pressure is expected to continue for many years to come.
""Since 2010, we have had five years of reducing council costs and finding savings of more that £200m.""
Labour county councillor Liz Brighouse said none of the county's centres should close, but said because of the ""massive cuts in budgets"" she did not know how the council could keep them all open.
""We have to make sure centres which are keeping children safe are properly funded and kept open,"" she added.
A further £2m is set to come from the subsidised transport budget, which includes home to school transport, concessionary bus passes and dial-a-ride.
Another £6.1m would be found from learning disability services.
The council had already announced it would need to find that money and is running a consultation called the Big Plan looking at changing ways in which learning disabilities services work.
There will also be another £3m of unidentified cuts that would come from adult social care.
The annual cost of a resident parking permit would also rise from £50 to £60.
The new cuts would be implemented from next April up until the end of March 2018.
The council's cabinet will consider the proposals on 16 December. Full council is expected to make a final decision in February.
The leader of Oxfordshire County Council sees its financial woes as a clear case for more devolution.
Conservative Ian Hudspeth says its ""the only way"" the council can keep providing services, as it spends an increasing proportion of its budget on social care.
Certainly, many councils have been frustrated by constraints imposed by central government.
Cherwell District Council has already said it is planning to do without its Revenue Support Grant from 2017, and many have railed against the 2% cap on council tax rises.

It was commissioned after the inquests and given to the government in June.
The Home Office said the report ""will be published in due course"".
Ms Hennessy, who was six years old when her father James Hennessy died, said time was ""hugely important"" for those affected.
""I do feel it should be an absolute priority. If the legacy of the the 96 is anything it should be that lessons are learned from mistakes,"" she added.
""I have told the Bishop's report about my experiences and given recommendations, especially because I grew up with the Hillsborough disaster.
""As a child I wasn't offered any counselling or support and this has had a long lasting effect on me as an adult. It would be awful if we don't learn from that.""
Rt Rev Jones was asked to produce the report by the prime minister following the conclusions of the Hillsborough inquests in April 2016.
Solicitor Elkan Abrahamson, who represents 22 of the families, has written to Theresa May asking her to distribute the report to the families ""immediately"" with a view to making the report public ""as a matter of urgency"".
He also wrote: ""We are concerned by the reaction of various authorities to Grenfell... and we believe that the Bishop's report will assist Central and Local Government and other organisations properly to perform their functions with the necessary diligence and compassion.""
Ms Hennessey urged Mrs May to make sure the Grenfell families were involved in the investigation and kept regularly updated.
She added: ""I wouldn't want to compare Grenfell to Hillsborough but if something happens like this you can't help but relate. It's heartbreaking.
""These families are in shock and grieving and are not being given answers.
""Time is very important. I appreciate the government has a lot to deal with but feel this report should be publicised at the earliest opportunity.""
During Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Alison McGovern, the Labour MP for Wirral South, asked when the report would be published.
Mrs May said she could not give a date as she had not yet seen the report but added she had commissioned it ""precisely because I was concerned about the way in which the bereaved families at Hillsborough had been treated over far too many years"".

358,"""If I was giving individual feedback on a daily basis as a teacher I would see my kids scores just skyrocket, but in some classrooms there might be 70, 80 students, and you can imagine how overwhelming that is for one teacher.""
From her experience, Ms Maraviglia, a 32-year-old American who had moved to Kenya to help start a program to support teachers, came up with the idea of teaching via mobile phone text messages.
Together with co-founder Kago Kagichiri they set up their business in Nairobi in 2011.
Eneza says it wants to make ""50 million students in Africa smarter"".
""Eneza is a virtual tutor and teachers' assistant,"" explains Ms Maraviglia.  ""It's a way for students to access courses through a low-cost cell phone.
""A lot of people [wrongly] think that our company is non-profit, because I am a woman, and because it's in education.
""We are a mission-based, for-profit company - what we do is charge an extremely low cost to our users and our business model is based on large scale.""
For many young people across Africa, the education available to them is often both under-resourced and costly to students and their families.
Limited public funds leave classrooms over-crowded, teachers over-stretched, and textbooks in short supply, while private schooling is prohibitively expensive for many.
Ms Maraviglia, who started out as a teacher in inner city New York after graduating from the University of California, jokes that she is the teacher who hated technology, and her Kenyan co-founder Mr Kagichiri is the techie who hated teachers.
""What really changed my mind about what's possible is Kago,"" she says. ""When a technologist and a teacher put their heads together they are able to really think of solutions that work.""
Eneza's 500,000 users access courses and quizzes almost exclusively by text messages, for a cost of just 10 Kenyan shillings (10 cents; six pence) per week, which is deducted from pre-paid airtime on their mobile phones. The company has also developed Android and web-based versions of the app, but text messages  remain the vast majority of its operations.
The emphasis on text messages enables users across rural Kenya to continue learning even if people can't afford to pay for data or expensive handsets, or if there is no data network in the area.
Eneza's courses target students from around 10 to 18-years-old, but also cater for school drop-outs up to the age of 25.
They are aligned to Kenya's national curriculum and cover subjects including maths, science, Kiswahili and English.
Learners receive questions - both multiple choice and open-ended - by text, and get feedback on their responses, whether right or wrong.
The app also features a built-in detective game called ""Where is Ms Mandizi?"" that sends more clues as learners progress, and users also accumulate points as they work their way through lessons.
""We are trying to bring 'gamefication' into the app, along with access to Wikipedia and an interactive chat - an environment in which people are learning, but at the same time being incentivised by fun things,"" says Mr Kagichiri, who taught himself to programme when he was eight-years-old.
Of the 500,000 users in Kenya - where mobile phone penetration is at one of the highest levels in sub-Saharan Africa - 70,000 are active users on a monthly basis.
""What we see from our students is that many of them will go home and study on this from 20 minutes to an hour every night,"" explains Ms Maraviglia.
Some of Eneza's so-called super-users are located in very remote parts of the country, including in Dadaab refugee camp near the Kenyan border with Somalia.
And while the Eneza team believes that at least 30% of their users do not go to school, in that they are drop-outs or older learners, the traditional education system remains critical to their work.
""From just 10 shillings every week, my child is given so many questions a day,"" says Beatrice Wambui, the mother of 12-year-old Peninah who is a  heavy user of Eneza.
""There were some topics my child did not know, Eneza stepped in and helped her.
""After she started using Eneza, she moved to second position at school, she had been in seventh place before.""
The team hope to roll out the Eneza app, ""Eneza"" means ""to spread"" in Swahili, in other African countries and they have already begun work in Tanzania and Ghana.
""We are really looking to be huge,"" says Ms Maraviglia.

It led to 6,000 more fans using the Leppings Lane entry.
The inquest hearing in Warrington is looking into the deaths of 96 Liverpool football fans following a crush at the Liverpool v Nottingham Forest FA Cup semi-final at the stadium on 15 April 1989.
Dr Eastwood said the extra spectators ""had to be catered for which was a factor in the build-up of the crowd"".

He also denies fraud by false representation.
Prosecutor Andrew Oliver told the court the discovery in Wyverstone, near Stowmarket, was the ""biggest stash of weapons this country had ever experienced"".

365,"Benjamin Netanyahu, the leader of the conservative Likud party, became prime minister after an inconclusive early election in February 2009, a decade after holding the office once before.
He has remained in power by negotiating Israel's volatile party system with skill, heading coalition governments with varying representation from left- and right-wing parties.
This 2009 government managed to steer Israel out of the global economic recession, but faced mounting protests about the rising cost of living.
It also failed to make any headway in relations with the Palestinians, Jewish settlers on the West Bank and the Obama administration in the United States.
Mr Netanyahu's repeated warnings over the perceived threat of Iran's nuclear programme have also complicated relations with the US.
A coalition dispute over the budget prompted Mr Netanyahu to call an early election in January 2013, which saw a boost for two relatively new parties - Yesh Atid in the centre and the pro-settler Jewish Home - in a campaign fought mainly on economic issues.
After months of wrangling the prime minister managed to assemble a coalition with these two parties, plus the small HaTnua splinter group from the Kadima centre party, that excluded most Jewish religious parties and raised the possibility of one of Israel's periodic attempts at rolling back the influence of ultra-Orthodox groups.
But tensions over tax breaks for first-time home buyers, and a controversial bill to reinforce the Jewish nature of the Israeli state, prompted Mr Netanyahu to sack the Yesh Atid and HaTnua leaders from the cabinet.
At early Knesset elections in March 2015, Mr Netanyahu scored a surprise victory over a resurgent Labour Party, now allied with HaTnua in the Zionist Union.
Following protracted negotiations, in May he formed a new coalition government with the right-wing Bayit Yehudi party and several smaller parties, two of them ultra-Orthodox, later supplemented by the right-wing Yisrael Beitenu party.During his previous term as prime minister in 1996-99 Mr Netanyahu was initially hostile towards the new Palestinian Authority, but went on to show some flexibility while maintaining a security-first policy.
Defeated by Labour leader Ehud Barak in 1999, he later served as finance minister under Likud PM Ariel Sharon, pushing through a series of market-oriented reforms before resigning in 2005 in protest at Mr Sharon's decision to pull out from Gaza.
Mr Netanyahu was born in 1949 in Tel Aviv, and spent part of his childhood in the United States where his father was a professor. During his five years in Israel's army, he served as captain of an elite commando unit. A fluent English-speaker, Mr Netanyahu has long been a prominent advocate for Israel in the international media.

The presidency is a largely ceremonial post and notionally above party politics, but individual presidents have used a combination of their personal prestige and the authority of their office to make interventions in national debates.
Reuven Rivlin, like his predecessor Shimon Peres, gives every sign that he will be such a president.
Born in 1939, a scion of an old Jerusalem family and a stalwart of the right-wing Likud party, President Rivlin has won respect across the political spectrum for his willingness to speak out on controversial issues.
In a country where the two-state solution remains the nominal preference of all major political parties, he supports integrating both Jewish settlers and potentially millions of Palestinians into a single state.
His opposition to the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza led to a very public rift with then Prime Minister Ariel Sharon during his term as speaker of the Knesset parliament in 2003-2006.
His relations with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were little warmer during his second term as speaker in 2009-2013. He makes a point of reaching out to Israel's Arab minority, saying that they form a ""bridge to peaceful co-existence"" with the Palestinians.
He beat centre-right politician Meir Sheetrit in a closely-fought parliamentary election for the presidency in June 2014, winning the support of both Arab and pro-settler Knesset members.",Prime minister: Benjamin Netanyahu,14628842
366,"Lewis Hamilton has been crowned world champion for the last two years ahead of Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg.
And Mercedes have dominated the constructors' title, winning 32 of 38 races and completing 23 one-twos.
""The regulations are incredibly stable for next year, so Mercedes will inevitably carry on the dominance,"" Horner told Autosport.
""People get turned off with predictability.""
He said it was up to the sport's senior officials to find a solution.
Horner believes the current situation is different to when Red Bull dominated F1 between 2010 and 2013.

367,"The Slovenia-based firm said the culprits had exploited a bug in the virtual currency's underlying software to carry out the assault.
It is the second exchange to suspend operations. Tokyo's MtGox took a similar measure on Friday.
A third, Bulgaria's BTC-e, has warned that some transactions may be delayed.
Like Bitstamp, it cited a denial-of-service (DoS) attack as the cause.
The Bitcoin Foundation - a group of developers who maintain and promote the cryptographic code on which the currency relies - said that it was creating workarounds and fixes to tackle the issue.
It added that people who had funds stored with the affected exchanges should know that their savings were safe, albeit ""tied up"" for the time being.
""This is a denial-of-service attack; whoever is doing this is not stealing coins, but is succeeding in preventing some transactions from confirming,"" wrote Gavin Andresen, chief scientist at the foundation.
""It's important to note that DoS attacks do not affect people's Bitcoin wallets or funds.""
Bitcoin is often referred to as a new kind of currency.
But it may be best to think of its units being virtual tokens rather than physical coins or notes.
However, like all currencies its value is determined by how much people are willing to exchange it for.
To process Bitcoin transactions, a procedure called ""mining"" must take place, which involves a computer solving a difficult mathematical problem with a 64-digit solution.
For each problem solved, one block of bitcoins is processed. In addition the miner is rewarded with new bitcoins.
This provides an incentive for people to provide computer processing power to solve the problems.
To compensate for the growing power of computer chips, the difficulty of the puzzles is adjusted to ensure a steady stream of about 3,600 new bitcoins a day.
To receive a bitcoin a user must have a Bitcoin address - a string of 27-34 letters and numbers - which acts as a kind of virtual post-box to and from which the bitcoins are sent.
Since there is no registry of these addresses, people can use them to protect their anonymity when making a transaction.
These addresses are in turn stored in Bitcoin wallets which are used to manage savings.
They operate like privately run bank accounts - with the proviso that if the data is lost, so are the bitcoins owned.
The cause of the problem is an issue called transaction malleability.
It involves someone changing the cryptographic code - known as a transaction hash - used to create an ID for the exchange of funds before it is recorded in the blockchain - a database of every transaction carried out in the currency.
On Monday, MtGox had suggested that this technique could be used to fool its systems into repeatedly making a payout because it would seem that it had not occurred.
The Bitcoin Foundation's initial response was that transaction malleability had been known about since 2011, and that MtGox should have prepared for this when developing its own customised software, which was now proving vulnerable.
""This is something that cannot be corrected overnight,"" wrote Mr Andresen.
But while other exchanges are not complaining about the risk of making unauthorised payouts, it appears their systems can become overwhelmed if they receive too many ""mutated versions"" of the transaction IDs.
""This is a denial-of-service attack made possible by some misunderstandings in Bitcoin wallet implementations,"" said Bitstamp's blog.
""These misunderstandings have simple solutions that are being implemented as we speak, and we're confident everything will be back to normal shortly.""
The Bitcoin Foundation now says its members and developers from a number of exchanges are working ""collectively and collaboratively"" to tackle the problem and allow withdrawals to resume.
One bitcoin is currently trading for about $665 (Â£402). That is well below the $830 level it was at last Thursday, reflecting investors' concern at the news.
However, one expert said the virtual currency should emerge from the attacks more robust than before.
""Obviously it's a bit more serious than was initially thought - it was originally believed that it was just a problem at MtGox because of the way they had set up their systems,"" Emily Spaven, editor of the news site Coindesk, told the BBC.
""The view from developers is that the exchanges should be processing bitcoin withdrawals again within 48-72 hours, though the wider issue of transaction malleability will take longer to address.
""It's been a bit of a wake-up call to get this issue fixed. I suppose they previously thought it wasn't that big a deal.""",Bitstamp - one of the world's largest Bitcoin exchanges - has halted withdrawals after coming under cyber-attack.,26155157
368,"The statement - stressing the importance of numeracy and literacy - was issued by John Swinney on Monday. It was originally due to be published in time for the start of term.
The education secretary said it was designed to ""reduce the burden of bureaucracy"" on teachers.
The EIS said turning the ""rhetoric into reality"" was now the challenge.
The new statement will also provide practical advice for teachers on planning and assessment and is aimed at helping reduce teachers' workload.
It is not expected to have an immediate, direct effect on students, as it it will be up to councils, schools and teachers to work out just how to put much of it into practice.
Speaking at the launch of the new guidance at St Roch's Primary and Hearing Impaired School in Glasgow, Mr Swinney said he believed it would make a difference.
""In the short period in which I have been the education secretary, I have been taking measures to simplify and clarify the experience of teachers and reduce the burden of bureaucracy,"" he said.
""The guidance that we have issued today is designed to do that across the whole of Scottish education.
""I am now working with the assessment and qualifications group to reduce the burden of assessment in the senior sector as well. We are making good progress on those discussions and I will be in a position to set out some further thinking in the weeks to come.""
EIS General Secretary Larry Flanagan welcomed the new guidance but said more had to be done to address excessive assessment workload for pupils and teachers and cut unnecessary bureaucracy.
He added:  ""We have heard similar statements in the past and progress has often been slow. Turning rhetoric into reality remains the challenge; we need to see concrete change in our schools with clear results, sooner rather than later.
""In particular, the issue of excessive assessment in the senior phase of secondary remains to tackled by both the Scottish government and the SQA.""
Mr Flanagan said classroom teachers also needed to be given more professional autonomy.
""The EIS will be issuing advice to members on how to use these latest publications effectively, in pursuit of our ambitions to declutter the curriculum, reduce the assessment burden and challenge needless paperwork.""
In May, following the publication of disappointing figures on numeracy, Mr Swinney said that while Curriculum for Excellence was a success, the importance of the basics like numeracy and literacy mattered.
The statement reaffirms the two key priorities for Curriculum for Excellence are:
Along with the statement, benchmarks have been published to support learning, teaching and assessment in Literacy and English and Numeracy and Mathematics.
The government said this would streamline existing assessment guidance.
Scottish Conservative education spokeswoman Liz Smith said parents were seeing ""lots of warm words"" about improving Curriculum for Excellence but ""no sign of improving educational standards across the board"".
She added: ""The SNP's failure to get to grips with our education system is yet another example of a government which has forgotten the day job because of its obsession with independence.""
Iain Gray, Scottish Labour's education spokesman, welcomed measures to reduce teacher workload but said more was needed than ""patronising platitudes"".
He added: ""The truth is that no warm words from John Swinney or guidance from Education Scotland can substitute for ending SNP cuts to education budgets, or replace the 4,200 teachers we have seen cut from schools.
""Until the SNP are prepared to use the powers of the parliament to provide enough funds to our schools, the pressure on teachers will continue.""
Tavish Scott, of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, said the guidance ""doesn't tell teachers anything new"".
""This was to be the acid test of reducing the paper chase of government guidance affecting teachers,"" he said. ""Yet it appears to tell teachers what they already know.""
""Teachers want clarity. Parents want teachers to teach. The Scottish government must redouble their efforts to achieve these objectives.""
Ross Greer, the Scottish Greens' education spokesman, said: ""Today's guidance is welcome. However, if Scottish ministers are serious about empowering teachers and reducing the attainment gap, they should take their own guidance on board and rethink their approach to national testing.""","New guidance on the curriculum in schools has been welcomed by Scotland's largest teachers' union, the EIS.",37210159
369,"That is understandable. The report into his care highlights a series of missed opportunities by the call handler who William's mother spoke to on the day before he died.  It makes it clear the handler should have probed more for information about his condition and immediately referred it on to a nurse or doctor.
This is just the latest in a long line for criticism for the telephone triage and advice service since it was rolled out three years ago. Much of it has focussed on the decision to reduce the ratio of nurses and doctors to call handlers when compared to its predecessor service, NHS Direct.
The lack of clinical training means the report excused the call handler from being guilty of ""serious failings"". That doesn't mean though that the way the system works does not need reviewing - and NHS England's head office is already saying it will look into whether it needs to change the processes that are followed.
But the report, produced by NHS England's south west office, also details other problems - and they have implications for the wider health service.
William, from Cornwall, had been ill for six to eight weeks before he died and had been seen by GPs at his local practice six times before his death. They too missed opportunities to diagnose a chest infection and pneumonia which led to the sepsis that killed him.
One of the visits was made two days before his death when his heart rate was not taken. It says it should have been.
By this point the sepsis would have taken hold and so, in all likelihood, William's heart rate would have been raised and, if indentified, should have led to him being referred for help.
The report excuses individuals of blame - and repeatedly makes the point that sepsis is often difficult to spot and there needs be greater understanding of the condition. But it does raise the question of whether these missed opportunities were a result of the pressures being placed on GPs, particularly not to make referrals to under-strain hospitals or prescribe antibiotics.
The actions of the out-of-hours GP who got in touch with the parents following the NHS 111 call was also highlighted. This was on a Saturday, the day before he died. The medic advised William's mother to let him sleep. If the medic had had access to William's medical records he might have insisted on seeing William.
But the goal of achieving fully shared patient records across the NHS is still one that has not been met despite repeated attempts.
Finally, the report raises the issue of services at weekends - and the support people get. Both the GP practice and out-of-hours doctors told William's parents to get back in touch if his condition worsened. But the investigators felt this was too vague, especially given the limited medical help available at weekends.
NHS bosses are now promising the lessons will be learned from William's death. His mother, Melissa, says they have to be.

370,"In a letter to staff, the company's chief executive Jean-Bernard Levy said the project needed to secure more funding from the French government.
He said the financial context was ""challenging"" and he was negotiating with the French state.
The UK government said it was ""committed"" to Hinkley.
Mr Levy said: ""We are currently negotiating with the French state to obtain commitments allowing us to secure our financial position.
""I am sure that this project is a good project for the group and that in the near future, all the conditions will come together for it to be definitely launched.
""It is clear that I will not engage EDF in this project before these conditions are met.""
The company, which is 85% owned by the French government, is expected to finalise in April how it will fund the project after postponing the decision a number of times. It was delayed in January reportedly owing to funding difficulties.
But Mr Levy highlighted in his letter that China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN), which will own 33.5% of the project, was investing about 8bn euros (£6bn).
He also expressed his confidence in EDF to manage ""very large projects"".
BBC business editor Simon Jack said the situation was like ""a high stakes game of poker"".
Some analysts are concerned the project could threaten EDF's financial viability but it would be ""incredibly embarrassing"" for the British government if the plant didn't go ahead.
Our editor said: ""[French president] Francois Hollande and David Cameron shook hands over this and it's a central piece of the UK's energy policy going forward, but the French government, the French unions and many French people are very worried that it could break the financial stability of the company that is building it.""
In light of the construction cost, the UK government has guaranteed it will pay £92.50 per megawatt hour for electricity from Hinkley, more than double current the wholesale electricity price of about £37 per megawatt hour.
By Simon Jack, BBC News business editor
Imagine British Gas owners Centrica got into financial trouble after sinking billions into a French power station. And then imagine that the bill for rescuing it fell on to taxpayers. That is essentially the risk facing EDF and the French government.
The dangers to the company's financial integrity are great enough to prompt EDF's chief financial officer to resign in protest, the French equivalent of the National Audit Office to issue stark warnings and French unions to lobby their members to vote against the project.
To make matters worse, EDF's recent track record in delivering big projects is poor. Reactor construction in France, Finland and China have run over time and massively over budget.
The prize for EDF with Hinkley Point is a guarantee to provide electricity for decades at three times the current price. The deal is still on but the stakes are high as a crucial EDF board meeting later this month approaches.
Angus McNeil, chair of the energy and climate change committee, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the entire scheme was a ""very expensive deal"" which had suffered ""major delays"".
He said it was plausible the government could ultimately pull out of the deal, or carry on with caveats. He said his committee's scrutiny of the project would ""go where the evidence takes us"".
Construction of Hinkley Point C in Somerset, the first new nuclear plant in the UK for 20 years and the most expensive in the world, is due to begin in 2019, two years after it had originally been due to open.
But Allan Jeffrey from the Stop Hinkley campaign group said he did not believe the scheme would ever go ahead and campaigners had grave concerns about nuclear power.
He said: ""There are so many problems - construction, technical and incredible financial problems.
""Nuclear power is an old fashioned form of energy where you throw away most of your energy, it's dangerous and risky and open to terrorist attacks. It's like having a nuclear bomb on site.
""We should be looking at Plan B which should be getting on with sustainable, renewable energy, why not use all the natural energy that's all around us?""
Simon Taylor, an economist at Cambridge University, said the letter from Mr Levy showed he was looking for reassurances from the other stakeholders.
He said: ""For them to put the French taxpayer on the hook for a project to supply very expensive electricity to the UK doesn't look economically attractive or politically attractive.""
He said it would be ""very embarrassing for the French government to cancel this"" but a pull-out from the UK side could also ""cast doubt on the UK's entire energy policy"" and jeopardise future projects.
Earlier this month, EDF's finance director Thomas Piquemal quit reportedly because he feared the project could jeopardise the company's financial position.
And in February, Chris Bakken, the director of the project, said he was leaving to pursue other opportunities.
Development has also been hindered by problems with a reactor.
European Pressurised Reactors (EPRs), in use in Flamanville, France, were found to have a construction fault meaning they were unable to handle the required pressure.
This pushed the Hinkley Point delivery date back as safety concerns were addressed.
A Department of Energy and Climate Change spokesman said: ""The British government is committed to Hinkley and committed to new nuclear.
""It is the only proven low-carbon technology that can provide continuous power, irrespective of whether the wind is blowing and the sun is shining. The industry will create thousands of jobs and benefit companies in the supply chain.""","Energy firm EDF has said it remains ""confident"" the £18bn Hinkley Point nuclear power plant will go ahead despite uncertainties over its funding.",35790824

372,"Ed Stone cannot say when the Voyager-1 spacecraft will leave the Solar System, but he believes the moment is close.
The latest data from this extraordinary probe, reported in this week's Science journal, suggests it is surfing right on the very edge of our Sun's domain.
The particles streaming away from our star have reduced to a trickle at its present location, 18.5 billion km from Earth.
Particles flying towards it from interstellar space, by contrast, have jumped markedly in the past year.
It all points to an imminent departure, which would make Voyager the first man-made object to cross into the space between the stars.
Find out how long it would take you
""It's hard to imagine there's another layer between the one we're in and the outside,"" Dr Stone told BBC News. ""Topologically, it makes sense that this is the outermost layer. The only question is: how thick is it?""
Launched way back in 1977, the probe has now travelled so far from home that its constant chatter of data takes 17 hours to arrive at the US space agency's receiving network. And chatter, it does.
Voyager's instruments are busy sampling the far-flung environment.  This has allowed Dr Stone and colleagues to map the shape and reach of the heliosphere - the giant bubble of charged particles blown off from our Sun.
In 2004, it reached a turbulent region referred to as the heliosheath, where particles bounced around in all directions.
It was expected this would be the final stage before the leap to interstellar space. But, as has been the case throughout this 35-year mission, Voyager threw up yet another surprise.
Last year, it detected what appears to be a discrete boundary layer that Ed Stone's team call the ""heliosheath depletion region"" in Friday's three Science papers.
It is a kind of magnetic highway where energetic particles on the inside can get out easily, and the galactic cosmic ray particles on the outside can zoom in.
""It is where the Sun's magnetic field has piled up, compressed up against itself.  It has also doubled in strength. It's smoother than anything we've ever seen with Voyager,"" Dr Stone explained.
The team is now watching the direction of the field lines very carefully.  Currently, they orientate east-west, wound into a spiral by the rotating Sun.  But when Voyager finally breaks through into interstellar space, they are expected to shift dramatically, running north-south.
This is an acid test for Dr Stone.  Although some might argue the particle data is evidence of Voyager being outside the Solar System, the project leader believes the probe cannot truly be said to be beyond the Sun's domain until it has also escaped our star's magnetic influence.
But do not expect an immediate, definitive announcement from Nasa that Voyager is in interstellar space when the magnetic signal does switch.
Instead, the instrument scientists will sit and listen to the probe's chatter, perhaps for several months.  They will want to be absolutely sure Voyager has broken through the so-called heliopause.
Like the surfer who rides the front of a breaking wave, battling the foam, Voyager will take some time to move completely clear of everything behind.
""The edge may be somewhat turbulent. We just don't know,"" Dr Stone told BBC News. ""This is exploration after all, and we will find out how Nature makes this interface. But it will be moving because the Sun does 'breathe' in and out.""
Voyager 1 is on course to approach a star called AC +793888, but it will only get to within two light-years of it and take some 40,000 years to make the passage.
Voyager 2, which was launched a few weeks before Voyager 1, is on a slightly slower path to interstellar space and is probably a few years from seeing the heliosheath depletion region.
Both probes have sufficient power in their plutonium ""batteries"" to keep working into the next decade.

In a speech she said her proposed timetable for a referendum would allow voters to make an informed choice.
Opposition parties said the SNP should focus on the job of government and respect the outcome of the 2014 referendum.
Theresa May has dismissed Ms Sturgeon's call for an independence vote in the autumn of next year or spring 2019, saying ""now is not the time"" for a referendum, while her government negotiates the best possible Brexit deal for the whole of the UK.
But the first minister said the terms of the Brexit deal should be clear by then, and she promised to give voters clear information on key issues such as what currency an independent Scotland would adopt.
Addressing the Political Studies Association annual conference in Glasgow, she said: ""Well before the referendum debate the Scottish government will also set out proposals for what an independent Scotland would look like, we will address issues such as the currency, our plans for fiscal stability and the process of securing our relationship with Europe in future.
""And we will do all of that with as much detail and clarity as possible.""
With Scotland again facing ""a time of intense political debate"", the first minister argued a second referendum would not necessarily split the country.
""Campaigns and politics are only divisive if we make them so, and we should be determined, all of us, not to make it so,"" she said.
She added: ""As first minister, I have a responsibility to lead by example. After all, the Scottish government has a special responsibility to build consensus where we can.
""So I will do my best to ensure that at all times we make our case not just with passion and conviction, but with courtesy, empathy and respect. I hope very much that all politicians will do the same.""
Scottish Conservative chief whip John Lamont said the first minister seemed ""unable to accept that a majority of Scots simply do not want another referendum"".
""The last thing Scotland needs right now is a divisive and unwarranted referendum. Instead it needs a Scottish government that gets on with the job it was elected to do, such as addressing the many problems facing our schools, hospitals and the economy,"" he said.
Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale also said Ms Sturgeon should focus on the business on government.
She said: ""Instead of constantly seeking to divide the country, the SNP should focus on the job of governing - tackling the crisis in our schools, fixing our broken NHS, and investing in local services.""

375,"The last game six years ago was the second leg of the first-ever Championship play-off final - and a defining moment in the histories of both clubs.
Exeter came away with 38-16 aggregate win and with it a place in the Premiership for the first time.
Bristol were left to lick their wounds in the second tier, and needed six more attempts before securing a return to the top flight last season.
So, as they prepare to face each other for the first time ever in the Premiership, what impact did that 2010 game have on the two clubs?
Gareth Steenson was Exeter's hero that night, kicking six penalties and two drop-goals, and six years on he is still a key cog in Exeter's attacking wheel, having been the Premiership's top points scorer last season.
""It was a great experience for anybody involved with the club at that time,"" says Steenson.
""There's a lot of people in Bristol that are still hurting about that, but I think more so with the supporters.
""They've suffered a few hard losses since then, but for us it was obviously a great experience and one that we kicked on from, and we've had some great experiences since.""
Since the second tier became the Championship in that 2009-10 season, Exeter and London Welsh are the only teams to win promotion without having been relegated from the Premiership the previous season.
And while Welsh went straight back down on both occasions - in 2014-15 they lost every game they played - Exeter slowly built and became the force they are today.
Last season the Chiefs reached the play-offs before losing to Saracens - and also made it through to the Champions Cup quarter-finals, but then suffered a last-second loss at Wasps.
So, when Bristol finally returned to the top flight this summer, it was to Exeter that they looked.
""They initially struggled when they went into the Premiership, but they've managed to sustain themselves and they've just grown on that,"" Bristol's former Wales scrum-half Martin Roberts said.
""They've got a good culture and that's exactly what we're trying to build here.""
Exeter's first season in the top flight saw them win their debut game at home to Gloucester, and earn five victories in their first 10 games on their way to finishing eighth.
Bristol, by contrast, have yet to win this season and were thrashed 70-22 at Wasps last Sunday.
""It's about overcoming the setbacks, learning from it and getting better,"" adds Roberts.
""We know we're not going to win every weekend, but it's about reducing our error count and putting our best foot forward.""
Friday will be the first evening Premiership game at Bristol's new Ashton Gate home; they left the Memorial Ground in the summer of 2014 to move in with Bristol City, with both clubs owned by billionaire sporting philanthropist Steve Lansdown.
""The fans will be well up for it, it's going to be a feisty old evening and a very loud one as well, so we're going to have to be on our toes,"" says Exeter prop Ben Moon, one of a handful of survivors left in the Exeter squad from 2010.
""There's always going to be a big rivalry between the two of us as we're two south west teams, it's going to be a big derby game for years to come if they stay up.""","Friday's Premiership meeting between Bristol and Exeter will be the first match between the two West Country teams for 2,313 days.",37429064

The fire engine was on its way to an out of control bonfire on St Ethelbert Avenue, at about 15:30 BST on 13 April.
Luton Borough Council said it has requested CCTV footage from the fire service.
Jacqui Brittain said she saw the fire engine coming down her road, with its lights on, from her bedroom window.
She said he continued to help one group of children from William Austin Junior School cross the road but to her surprise then started a second crossing.

377,"The cartoon depicts a beer-swilling Aboriginal man being handed back his errant son by a police officer - and, on being instructed to teach the boy about ""personal responsibility"", struggling to remember his name.
Drawn by one of Australia's best known cartoonists, Bill Leak, the satirical image caused an uproar when it appeared in The Australian newspaper in August.
Some condemned it as unfairly tarnishing all Aboriginal fathers; others applauded it for highlighting an unpalatable truth. But was it racist, and should it have been banned by law?
These questions are exercising federal politicians as they prepare to hold an inquiry into the Racial Discrimination Act, focusing on a contentious section which outlaws behaviour likely to ""offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate"" people on the basis of race, colour or ethnic origin.
The section, 18C, is anathema to conservatives, who call it a gag on freedom of speech. They point to the cartoon and another recent case, involving racism allegations against three Queensland University of Technology (QUT) students, as underlining the need for reform.
Defenders of the law, though, who include opposition Labor politicians, ethnic community organisations and the UN special rapporteur on racism, say it has worked well for 20 years, protecting Australians from ethnic minority backgrounds from harassment and intimidation.
They also note that the act - under which discrimination complaints are initially investigated by the Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) - operated without controversy until 2011, when the Federal Court ruled it had been breached by a leading right-wing commentator, Andrew Bolt.
Mr Bolt had published articles and blogs in which he accused nine fair-skinned Australians with mixed heritage of playing up their Aboriginality to secure jobs, grants and awards.
The judgement outraged his friends and ideological soulmates, who include former Prime Minister Tony Abbott.
Mr Abbott's government drafted amendments diluting the act in 2014, but backed down following an outcry from community groups - and from MPs in the ruling Liberal Party who represent ethnically diverse urban electorates.
Those same groups are now mobilising again as battle lines are drawn on an issue which arouses strong opinions and emotions on both sides of the political divide.
While Australia prides itself on its multiculturalism, with more than one in four people born overseas, some are uneasy at what Tim Wilson, a prominent libertarian turned Liberal MP, calls ""the direction of the country... its ethno-cultural make-up and whether we're holding to our values and traditions"".
The parliamentary inquiry has been ordered by Mr Abbott's successor, Malcolm Turnbull, who only a few months ago ruled out changes to the Racial Discrimination Act.
Once known as a social progressive, Mr Turnbull, who won power in July by the narrowest of margins, is discovering that government requires harsh compromises. Not only is he under pressure from right-wing Liberals, but he has to court the likes of Pauline Hanson's anti-immigration One Nation to get legislation through the Senate.
One of four One Nation senators, Ms Hanson wants 18C repealed, as does David Leyonhjelm, another Senate cross-bencher who espouses libertarian causes.
The push for reform gathered momentum following the cartoon and QUT rows, the latter involving Facebook posts by the three students after they were asked to leave a computer lab reserved for Aboriginal students. One wrote: ""I wonder where the white supremacist lab is.""
Both affairs prompted complaints to the AHRC by apparently injured parties. In the Bill Leak case, the complaints were subsequently dropped. In the QUT case, the Federal Court dismissed the discrimination claim as having no reasonable chance of success.
On Monday, the UN special rapporteur on racism, Mutuma Ruteere, called for the Racial Discrimination Act to be protected, describing it as a ""useful balance"" between free speech and protecting minority groups.
Removing it would ""open the door to racist and xenophobic hate-speech which has been quite limited thanks to this provision"", he said.
While there is little likelihood of 18C being repealed, opponents are calling for, at the very least, the words ""insult"" and ""offend"" to be removed, maintaining that they ""set the bar too low"" for a claim to succeed under the act.
Mr Wilson told the BBC that the passions surrounding the topic ""feed into a cultural concern about whether we're preserving the best type of society we've been in the past ... based on Western traditions of freedom of religion, freedom of speech and liberal democracy"".
He said: ""It's about whether the law should be used as a weapon to censor and silence conversations on difficult subjects. The reality is: people use their freedom of speech to say challenging and offensive things all the time, and that's what a free society is.""
A recent study found that only 1.8% of complaints end up in a court or tribunal, with the rest dropped, dismissed or conciliated by the AHRC.
The QUT and Leak cases were ""highly exceptional"", one of the report's authors, Katharine Gelber, from the University of Queensland, told the BBC. She also noted that the following section of the Act, 18D, provides a broad ""public interest"" defence.
At a time of rising populism globally, including a growing backlash against ""political correctness"", the 18C debate ""hits right at the heart of the political divide"", Prof Gelber said.","Two high-profile cases involving allegations of racism have reignited a row about free speech in Australia, and mobilised the nation's ideological forces, writes Kathy Marks.",38205024

The child has since been discharged from hospital. The three adults are believed to have non-life threatening injuries.

380,"The Curiosity robot used its wideangle science camera placed high up on a mast to acquire the frames.
The low-resolution vista shows at centre the big mountain that lies in the middle of Gale Crater, the deep depression in which the rover landed.
Curiosity's ultimate goal is to drive towards this peak - informally known as Mount Sharp - to study its rocks.
""This is a very low-resolution panorama,"" explained Mike Malin, the principal investigator on the rover's Mastcam cameras.
""The individual frames are only 144 by 144 pixels.  There are 130 of them in there. It took us about an hour and six minutes to take the mosaic.
""For the full-resolution panorama, the data volume will be 64 times larger, [and] the resolution will be eight times better. But this was pretty enough and interesting enough that we thought it was worth sharing with you guys,"" he told BBC News.
The colour is what the camera saw. Apart from the process of blending the individual frames, the only modification made was to brighten the image slightly.
Pictures are deliberately acquired underexposed so as not to saturate any bright regions in the field of view.

The full-resolution frames are currently held in the camera memory, but at 4MB per shot it will take some time to get them all back on Earth.
Curiosity has two Mastcams.  The one that took this panorama has a focal length of 34mm.  The other camera has a 100mm telephoto lens. The two can be used together to make stereo pictures.
The Mastcams will be paramount in helping to plan Curiosity's science mission, choosing where to drive and which rock targets to investigate.
Researchers want eventually to take the robot to the base of Mount Sharp.
Evidence from satellite photos has suggested there are sediments exposed at the base of the 5.5km-high peak that were laid down in the presence of abundant water.
The rover will use its instruments to try to understand what kind of environments existed at the time of the rocks' formation, and whether there were periods in Mars history when any type of microbial life could have thrived.
The Curiosity rover mission is being run out of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory here in Pasadena, California.
A large team of scientists is planning the future work of the vehicle.
The group has divided the ground around the landing site into a series of 1.3km by 1.3km boxes, and has been systematically mapping terrain features and rock textures seen in satellite and rover imagery on to those quadrangles.
""We will use this map to find a path from where we landed to the main target at the base of Mount Sharp,"" explained Dawn Sumner, a mission scientist and geologist from the University of California at Davis.
""On the way, we're going to have a lot of interesting geology to look at but the team will have to balance our observations and investigations on our drive [with the need] to get to the base of Mount Sharp.""
It could take a year or more to reach key locations at the base of the mountain which are some 6.5km away.
Nasa has announced that the quadrangle in which Curiosity currently sits has been named Yellowknife, after the capital of the Canadian Northwest Territories.
Yellowknife was a settlement established by prospectors in the early 20th Century.

381,"EU ambassadors who met on Tuesday had noted some ""encouraging developments"" since the 5 September ceasefire was agreed, an EU spokeswoman said.
But other parts of the peace deal ""will need to be properly implemented"", said the spokeswoman, Maja Kocijancic.
The sanctions target senior Russian officials, as well as Russia's oil industry, defence firms and banks.
Western governments and the Ukrainian authorities in Kiev accuse Russia of supplying the separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine with heavy weapons and soldiers.
Russia denies the allegations.
EU and US sanctions have been in place since Russia's annexation of Crimea in March.
At least 3,200 people have died in fighting since April in Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions, and thousands of civilians have fled the conflict.
A shaky ceasefire has held since 5 September, and the two sides have since agreed to set up a 30km (19-mile) buffer zone.
But there have been frequent flare-ups of violence.
At least seven Ukrainian soldiers died in a clash with pro-Russian rebels near Donetsk airport on Monday - the deadliest single incident for the military since the truce deal.
A tank shell hit the vehicle carrying the troops, officials said.
More heavy shelling was reported on Tuesday in the Donetsk airport area.
Last week Ukraine's Prime Minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, told the UN General Assembly that Russian troops were still operating in eastern Ukraine.
He urged the West not to lift sanctions until his country regained control of all its territory.

384,"The prime minister is facing a rebellion by Conservative MPs who do not want the UK to continue to be party to the EU-wide agreement.
The PM says the arrest warrant has been substantially reformed and that it is in the UK's interest to sign up again.
Labour has pressed Mr Cameron to hold a vote within the next week.
The UK has to decide by 1 December whether to continue to adhere to a host of EU criminal justice and law enforcement measures, including the European Arrest Warrant, under the terms of the 2009 Lisbon Treaty.
Conservative backbenchers have long called for a specific Commons vote on the European Arrest Warrant, which allows the quick extradition of suspects around the EU.
Pressure has grown in recent weeks for the vote to be held before the Rochester by-election, in which UKIP, which wants to leave the EU entirely, hopes to snatch the seat from the Conservatives.
The Home Office, the police and the security services say the EU Warrant is a vital tool to protect the UK but some Conservative MPs argue that it has been abused and has become a threat to the liberties of Britons, and the sovereignty of the UK.
Labour leader Ed Miliband has offered Mr Cameron his party's support in a vote over the European Arrest Warrant, meaning that the measure - which is also backed by the Liberal Democrats - is likely to be passed by the Commons.
But the BBC's chief political correspondent Vicky Young said up to 100 Conservative MPs could rebel.
Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons, Mr Cameron rejected Labour claims that he was putting off a vote on the issue until after the Rochester by-election because he was running scared of UKIP.
He said a vote could not be held until negotiations elsewhere in Europe had concluded and the threat of a block by Spain had been lifted.
""I'm not delaying having a vote on it, there will be a vote on it,"" he said. ""We are going to have a vote and we are going to have it before the Rochester by-election.""
The prime minister said the UK had already agreed to opt out of 100 other EU justice provisions, which he said amounted to the biggest single transfer of powers back from Brussels to the UK.
But he added: ""It is important we take action to keep Britain safe, particularly from serious criminals and terrorists, and the European arrest warrant offers the best way of doing that.
""I would stress to those who are concerned about this, the European Arrest Warrant is very different from the arrest warrant first introduced under the last Labour government.
""You cannot now be extradited for something that isn't a crime in Britain, judges are able to reject European Arrest Warrants and they have done so in many, many cases.
""And you can't be extradited if there is going to be a long period of detention. These are all important considerations.""
Conservative MP John Redwood said he was ""disappointed"" at Mr Cameron's continued support for the EAW and said it would result in a ""happier party and a happier country"" if the UK negotiated a separate set of arrangements with other EU countries to maintain its ""legal independence"".",David Cameron has said a vote on the future of the European Arrest Warrant will be held before the Rochester and Strood by-election on 20 November.,29821692
385,"When, in 1977, James Earl Carter Jr blew into Washington DC ""like a Southern breeze"", the 39th President of the United States symbolised a bright, new future.
He'd emerged from the obscurity of a peanut farm in his native Georgia as a man of honesty, armed with the slogan ""Trust Me"".
With the country still reeling from the Watergate scandal, this platform had much appeal. With unprecedented informality, he insisted on being called Jimmy, and he and his wife Rosalynn walked hand-in-hand from Capitol Hill to the White House on Inauguration day.
Yet, Jimmy Carter was dumped from the presidency after serving just one four-year term, the first elected president to be defeated in office since 1932. But in the more than 30 years since, his second act as a world statesman has changed his legacy.
Born in Plains, Georgia in 1924, as a child, Jimmy was expected to work long hours on the farm, and home life was austere. His nearest neighbours were his black staff who became his closest friends.
When his father died of cancer, Jimmy Carter abandoned a seven-year career in the navy as a submariner to take control of the family farm. He turned its fortunes around and became wealthy in the process.
He entered politics in the 1960s, elected first as Georgia state senator during a special election  - starting his campaign only two weeks before voting. After an initial defeat for the governorship of Georgia, he was elected to the state's top office in 1970 - a position he would use as a springboard to the White House.
As a office holder, Mr Carter was driven by a mixture of born-again Christian spirit, a sense of independence and a liberal tradition. The latter was inherited, not from his father, who was a white segregationist, but from his mother, Lillian, who joined the Peace Corps at the age of 68, and spent two years working as a nurse in India.
His sister, a faith healer, had by then convinced him to commit himself totally to God. As president, he continued to preach at Sunday school for children and always said grace before meals, even at state dinners with foreign leaders.
After a narrow election victory against incumbent Gerald Ford in the 1976 presidential election, problems quickly mounted for Mr Carter. At home, the oil crisis had produced high inflation and unemployment, and he struggled to persuade Americans to accept the required austerity measures.
The high-point of the Carter years was the signing of the Camp David Accords in 1978 in which Egypt formally recognised the state of Israel. He also signed a treating returning the Panama canal to Panama.
But subsequent events conspired against him. First, the Shah of Iran was overthrown and 66 Americans were taken hostage in Tehran. Then the Soviets invaded Afghanistan.
The resulting US boycott of the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow failed to gain enough support to get them cancelled. He cut off diplomatic relations with Iran and introduced a trade embargo.
But the public did not believe he was being tough enough and his popularity slumped. When an attempt to rescue the hostages failed, and eight Americans military members were killed, Carter appeared even weaker.
To compound his plight, Iran delayed the release of the hostages until after the new president, Ronald Reagan, was sworn in. It was left to Reagan to make America feel good about itself once more.
Instead of disappearing, Jimmy Carter used the prestige of his former office to become a diplomat and mediator across the world under the auspices of his newly founded Carter Centre, based in Atlanta.
He worked behind the scenes to keep the Middle East peace process on track, persuaded the former North Korean dictator, Kim Il Sung, to open discussions with South Korea.
Mr Carter led a delegation that persuaded leaders in Haiti to surrender power in 1994 and he brokered a ceasefire in Bosnia that helped pave the way for the future peace treaty there.
He very quickly added election monitoring to the Carter Centre, famously denouncing the 1989 election in General Noriega's Panama. then advised Daniel Ortega on organising fair elections in Nicaragua which, ironically, resulted in Ortega's defeat.
The Carter Centre has also established health programmes which pushed for the eradication of guinea worm, and is successfully tackling river blindness.
As Mr Carter continued working across the world, his reputation as a failed one-term president soon began to subside.
Such is his worldwide standing after leaving office, Fidel Castro allowed him to broadcast live to the Cuban people in Spanish, despite knowing he would criticise the Cuban leader's civil rights record.
Mr Carter is not without his critics. Some non-governmental organisations working in the field have accused him of often acting unilaterally and have questioned his commitment to longer-term projects.
In 2002, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his ""decades of untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts"".
In his acceptance speech, Mr Carter said ""war may sometimes be a necessary evil. But no matter how necessary, it is always an evil, never a good. We will not learn how to live together in peace by killing each other's children"".
The former president has spoken strongly out against some decisions who followed him in the presidency - including the war in Iraq under George W Bush and continuing mass surveillance under Barack Obama, saying Edward Snowden should be considered for a pardon.
He has also criticised Israel's actions with respect to Palestine in a 2006 book ""Palestine - Peace not Apartheid"", which attracted criticism from many elected leaders in his own Democratic party.
Since 2007, Mr Carter has also become a part of The Elders, a group founded by Nelson Mandela of elder global leaders who no longer hold public office, along with Kofi Annan, Ela Bhatt and Mary Robinson.
In August 2015, Mr Carter announced cancer initially found in his liver had spread to become a melanoma in four spots on his brain and that he was to undergo treatment. In December that year he told a Sunday school class in Plains, Georgia, that an MRI scan had revealed no sign of the brain cancer.",Former US President Jimmy Carter is now remembered for more than his time in the White House.,34006916

Tory MP Mr Crabb told the BBC's Sunday Politics Wales programme that the UK government had ""moved mountains"".

Mr Poroshenko said he would meet Russian leaders soon but vowed to take a tough line on any armed separatists.
Unrest continues in the east, with pro-Russia militiamen halting flights at Donetsk airport.
Heavy gunfire is now reported there, with thick black smoke rising from the area. Military aircraft have been seen overhead.
Meanwhile election observers said Sunday's vote was a genuine one that largely met international standards.
The mission from the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) also said it gave the new president ""legitimacy"" to open a dialogue with separatists in the east.
Mr Lavrov told a press conference in Moscow: ""We are ready for dialogue with Kiev's representatives, with Petro Poroshenko.""
Mr Lavrov said EU and US mediation were not needed, but warned Kiev that continuing military operations against the separatists would be a ""colossal mistake"".
He said: ""As our president [Vladimir Putin] has said, we shall treat the results of the expression of will of the Ukrainian people with respect.""
But Mr Lavrov said Kiev must also treat its people with respect and that dialogue with the east was necessary to resolve the crisis.
Mr Poroshenko said he hoped to meet Russian leaders early next month, after a trip to Poland where he will meet the US president and EU leaders.
However, he warned he would take a tough line on armed militiamen.
He said: ""Their goal is to turn Donbass [east Ukraine] into Somalia. I will not let anyone do this to our state and I hope that Russia will support my approach.""
Mr Poroshenko also indicated he would keep current Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk, saying: ""There are no plans to change the government leadership.""
Mr Poroshenko, 48, currently has 53.75% of the vote, with 70% of the ballots counted, and would not need a run-off. Former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko is a distant second on 13.1%.
Full results are expected on Monday.
The election came three months after pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych fled Kiev amid bloody street protests and calls for closer ties with the EU.
Since then, Russia has annexed the Crimean peninsula in southern Ukraine and armed separatists in the eastern provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk have declared independence.
Mr Yanukovych has also said he will accept the election result, ""no matter which regions and what percentage of the population voted"", Russian media reported.
Ukraine's interim government is engaged in an offensive in the east to quash the uprising that has left scores dead.
Pro-Russian separatists severely disrupted voting there. No polling stations were open in Donetsk city, and across the region only seven out of 12 district electoral commissions were operating.
""Has Ukraine been reborn?"" asks the Ukrainian edition of Komsomolskaya Pravda. It says the election ""will have a special place in the history books"". But the paper notes that Crimeans did not vote and the voting in Donbass and Luhansk - formerly Ukraine's ""electoral core"", proceeded with ""great difficulty"".
""We have survived,"" proclaims popular Ukrainian daily Segodnya.
Claims in the Russian media that Ukraine is overrun by extremists and neo-Nazis are ridiculed by some social media commentators. The two right-wing candidates - Dmytro Yarosh and Oleh Tyahnybok - polled less than 2% in total.
Prominent Ukrainian journalist Mustafa Nayyem proclaims an ""epic fail"" of Russian propaganda. ""Vladimir Putin won't sleep tonight,"" he predicts.
:A turning point, or business as usual?
However, the central elections commission said about 60% of Ukraine's 35.5 million eligible voters had turned out.
Unrest continued on Monday.
Flights were suspended at Sergei Prokofiev airport in Donetsk after several dozen separatists from the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic demanded Ukrainian troops guarding the inner perimeter be removed.

389,"The Swiss, who claims to have ""overwhelming"" support for the plan to increase the number of teams at the finals from 32, favours 16 groups of three countries, with the top two progressing to the knockout rounds.
If successful, it would lead to the first World Cup expansion since 1998.
There are five options world football's governing body will consider.
Infantino, 46, succeeded fellow Swiss Sepp Blatter as Fifa president in February 2016, having campaigned on a promise of expansion.
The former general secretary of Uefa [European football's governing body] initially suggested a 40-team tournament - an idea put forward by then-Uefa president Michel Platini in 2013 - before shifting focus to a 48-nation finals.
The five options the 37-member Fifa council will choose from are:
In Infantino's favoured option, the number of games rises from 64 to 80, but the finals can still be played within the existing tournament duration of 32 days, while a nation will play no more than seven matches, as in the present format.
One potential flaw is that penalty shootouts may have to be introduced to settle drawn group matches to prevent two sides playing out a result in the last round of games that ensures both countries progress.
Speaking at a sports conference in Dubai in December, Infantino said the World Cup has to be ""more inclusive"" and that expansion will also benefit ""the development of football all over the world"".
He added: ""There is nothing bigger in terms of boosting football in a country than participating in a World Cup.""
Despite saying ""the decision should not just be financially driven"", Infantino did highlight the possible financial upsides.
According to Fifa's own research, revenue is predicted to increase to £5.29bn for a 48-team tournament, giving a potential profit rise of £521m.
Infantino has said that Fifa's 211 member federations are ""overwhelmingly in favour"" of a 48-team tournament, with the bulk of the 16 extra places expected to go to Africa and Asia.
England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are all reportedly expected to back the expansion, as long as Europe is offered guarantees of extra spots.
Fifa is not planning to allocate the extra slots at Tuesday's vote. Europe currently has 13 places which could potentially rise to 16 with one European country in each group.
Scottish FA chief executive Stewart Regan has said that expansion is ""a positive thing for the smaller nations"", citing the performances of Wales, Iceland and Northern Ireland in the expanded 24-team Euro 2016 tournament.
Venezuelan Football Federation president Laureano Gonzalez has reportedly said that Fifa has proposed merging the North and South American qualifiers for a 48-team World Cup in 2026.
Gonzalez, who is also vice-president of South American governing body Conmebol, said that any support for the idea would depend on increasing their current combined share of seven places.
""If this went up to 14, similar to what Europe has for more or less the same number of teams, the idea would catch on,"" he added.
While Britain's Fifa vice-president David Gill is expected to support the expansion plan, English Football Association chief executive Martin Glenn says the organisation would prefer to retain the current format.
""I can't influence Fifa - we're one voice out of 211,"" Glenn told BBC Radio 5 live Sportsweek.
""Our preference would be to keep the tournament smaller, because there's a quality factor here. But we'll try to influence the shape of it.""
The main opposition so far has come from Germany, with football federation president Reinhard Grindel arguing that adding more teams could ""strengthen the imbalance"" seen at some tournaments.
The European Club Association (ECA), which represents the interests of the top club sides in Uefa, is also against the proposals, saying that an expanded tournament will mean more call-ups, injuries and congestion in the fixtures calendar.
""In the interest of the fans and the players, we urge Fifa not to increase the number of World Cup participants,"" said ECA chairman and former Germany international Karl-Heinz Rummenigge.

Brown credited ""phenomenal manager"" Brendan Rodgers for Celtic's stunning season, and looked back at the Northern Irishman's first game in charge - a shock 1-0 first-leg Champions League qualifying defeat by Lincoln Red Imps of Gibraltar.
""From the start of the season, away to Gibraltar, nobody would've expected this,"" the Scotland international added. ""But it shows how well we prepared and how much dedication we put into the whole season.
""What we've just achieved, I don't think it will sink in for a few days.""
The treble was sealed against Aberdeen thanks to a late Tom Rogic goal at Hampden on Saturday.
Jonny Hayes had given an impressive Dons outfit an early lead, before Stuart Armstrong quickly levelled with a fine left-footed strike.

Aberdeen, who also finished second in the Scottish Premiership and runners-up in the League Cup, provided Rodgers' side with possibly their most testing domestic contest of the campaign on Saturday.
And despite their dominance this term, Brown admitted the sense of occasion may have played on the minds of the Celtic players in the first half at Hampden.
""The nerves got to us a little bit in the first half. But we sat down in the dressing room, the gaffer was brilliant, and we went out in the second half and knew what we had to do,"" he added.
""There's always nerves in big games - and to go through the season undefeated, to win the treble, there's always going to be nerves.""
Those worries were gone by the time Rogic netted the late winner, with Celtic having dominated the latter stages of the showpiece.
""Its hard to put into words,"" said the Australian match-winner. ""I don't think it has sunk in yet.
""When we look back on going unbeaten through the season domestically with the amount of games we play, and to clinch the treble like that in the last minute is a pretty cool moment.""",Celtic captain Scott Brown says the current squad is the best he has played with in his decade at the club.,40077651

That made for a grandstand finish with Vincent's goal ensuring after just 21 years of existence, Inverness have their hands on a major trophy.
Here, BBC Scotland's Richard Wilson gives his marks out of 10 for the two sides.
Dealt with mainly long-range efforts from Falkirk with relative ease. Was almost caught in possession of the ball inside his area, but otherwise was composed throughout.
Spent most of the game in the unfamiliar position of right-back, and only once cut inside onto his stronger left-foot to shoot. Reliable as ever, but not as prominent in an attacking sense as he can be.
In for the suspended Gary Warren, and played with discipline and intent. A strong defender who was solid and reliable throughout.
A less controversial display than the semi-final, when his handball was one of the defining moments. A mobile centre-back, but did find Botti Biabi's pace and elusiveness difficult to deal with.
Was having a good game, attacking dynamically down the left, until he stumbled on the ball inside his own half. Had to be dismissed when he then brought down Blair Alston, and left the field in tears.
Another hard-working display in central midfield, but was less prepared to try his luck with shots from distance than he normally does.
Covered a lot of ground in central midfield as he always does. The industry was particularly necessary when Inverness were reduced to 10 men, but was fortunate when the ball bounced off his knee into his arm on edge of penalty area and he wasn't penalised.
Burst past Peter Grant and Jamie MacDonald to slide the ball into the empty net for the opening goal and stretched the Falkirk defence with his pace and direct running. Also involved in the winning goal, with his shot pushed into Vincent's path.
Created the opening goal for Watkins with a clever reverse pass and was the busiest of Inverness's creative players in the opening half.
Had licence to drift in off right flank but struggled to impose himself on the game. Was expected to be a creative force, but looked forlorn when he was substituted in the 72nd minute for the eventual match-winner Vincent.
Mostly played in a deeper position behind Watkins, but won plenty of high balls in the air and kept up his work rate deep into the game.
Kept on at his players in the second half when Falkirk were in the ascendancy and his willingness to always be positive was eventually rewarded.
Made some regulation saves with typical competence, but will feel that he should have held Watkins' shot rather than push it straight out to Vincent.
Struggled in the first-half with Doran and Tremarco attacking down the left. Was involved in attack after the break, but crosses were seldom effective enough.
Was otherwise having a commanding game, but his slip and misjudgement of the flight of the ball allowed Watkins to break upfield for the winning goal. Looked distraught after the final whistle.
Powerful in the air and made three excellent recovery tackles in the first-half. Topped off an impressive display with the header for Falkirk's equaliser.
Spent the first-half defending and he second-half attacking. The delivery of the ball with his left foot was always effective.
Clipped a volley over when the ball bounced to him inside the area and delivered the free-kick for Grant's equaliser. Was otherwise quieter than might have been expected.
Along with Grant, Falkirk's best performer. Anchored the midfield, passed the ball well and peppered shots on target throughout the game. Unfortunate to be on the losing side.
A busy, terrier-like performance in midfield. Hared around after the ball and played his part as Falkirk dominated possession in the second half.
Played his way to greater prominence after the break, when he moved to a more conventional central midfield role. Passed the ball cleverly and was always capable of carrying it past opponents with his elusive running.
Started on the left flank and made a couple of runs in behind Shinnie in the first-half, but failed to capitalise. Moved up front after the break, but was replaced by Biabi, who was more effective.
Ran the channels and was always available for the ball. Never really had a clear chance on goal, but contributed to Falkirk's build up play until he eventually ran out of stamina late in the game.
His team was well organised in the first-half, but switch to 4-4-2 at the break allowed them to take control of the game and Falkirk deserved to equalise.

394,"A memorial service for the 1,500 people who died was held at the North Atlantic wreck site on cruise ship MS Balmoral, which is retracing the Titanic's route.
A minute's silence was held and wreaths were cast into the sea at the moment the Titanic sank.
And a plaque featuring the names of those who died was unveiled in Belfast.
The ship, which at the time was the largest vessel in the world, was built in the city.
The plaque, in the Titanic Memorial Garden, lists the names of those who died in alphabetical order.
By Chris BucklerBBC News on MS Balmoral
In the middle of the Atlantic a ship's whistle sounded to mark exactly 100 years since the Titanic struck an iceberg.
At that moment passengers stood in silence on the decks all around the MS Balmoral looking out into the darkness.
Hundreds of miles from land some imagined the despair they would have felt being lowered into the sea in a lifeboat. Others thought of their relatives who had drowned here a century earlier.
After the excitement of the departure and earlier days at sea, the ship seemed eerily quiet.
In the cold of the north Atlantic one person described the atmosphere as ""almost ghostly"".
The Balmoral had traced the route of the Titanic from Southampton to the spot where the ship sank. There it was met by another vessel that had travelled from New York, the destination Titanic never reached.
The ships sat side-by-side thousands of metres above the wreckage, allowing passengers to pay tribute at what some relatives regard as a grave site.
Thousands attended or listened to the Belfast service, which was held at the city hall.
Una Reilly, head of the local Titanic Society, said: ""We are all proud of this ship. What happened was a disaster, she was not.""
And a memorial service was held in Southampton, from where the ship set sail five days before its sinking.
The anniversary has been marked in a number of services across the UK.
Earlier, on the Balmoral, passengers and crew members listened in silence as the names were read out of those who died when the liner sank on its maiden voyage.
Jane Allen's great-uncle, Thomas Pears, was one of those who died.
Explaining the emotions she felt during the service, she told the BBC: ""It was just so eerily quiet.
""And then you look down over the side of the ship and you realise that every man and woman who was not fortunate enough to get into a lifeboat had to make that decision of when to jump or to stay with the ship, until the lights went out.
""And when the lights went out it must have been horrendous. We witnessed that tonight.""
Melinda Norris, whose relative Charles Lightoller was a surviving crew member, said: ""You still get a chill just looking at that water, imagining you have to go into it.
""We've been listening to the names of the 1,500 people who died.
""It's just an unimaginable amount of suffering took place here, so it's surreal to be here.""
Richard Hyman's great-grandfather was also on board Titanic and lived to tell the tale.
Mr Hyman said: ""You imagine it's pitch black, freezing cold, nothing is anywhere near you other than an iceberg.
""The fear that must have been with all those people who were either stuck on the ship or in a lifeboat, not knowing whether they were going to survive or not.
""And people did freeze to death as well, even though they'd survived the disaster.""
Another cruise ship, Azamara Journey, which has travelled from New York, also held a service at the site of the disaster, which occurred 400 miles (640km) off the coast of Newfoundland.
The sinking is also being remembered in other parts of the globe including New York, which had been the Titanic's intended destination.
About 1,300 passengers, ranging from millionaires to poor emigrants, and about 900 crew were on board the Titanic when it sank on its maiden voyage.
The ship left Southampton on 10 April 1912. It headed to Cherbourg in France and Queenstown - now Cobh - in the Irish Republic before heading for New York.
The ship hit an iceberg at 23:40 (Ship's Time) on 14 April 1912, and sank two-and-a-half hours later.","The 100th anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic is being remembered at a number of a special events, including one in the ship's birthplace Belfast.",17715345

399,"That single act trumped the Soviet achievement of sending the first man into space eight years earlier. But what might have happened if the Soviet Union had got to the Moon first?
The first manned lunar landing was a triumph for Nasa, and when the Americans won the Space Race, they also sounded its death knell.
The Apollo lunar programme continued until 1972 and 12 astronauts touched down on the Moon's surface. But US TV networks quickly bored of the Moon landings. When politicians lost interest, the Apollo programme was scrapped.
Of course, we have not been back since. Instead, human exploration of space has been confined to low-Earth orbit.
Piers Bizony, who has co-written a biography of Gagarin called Starman, says: ""The Russians were in the business of conquering space... The Americans felt they were in a race and the nature of a race is that once you think you've won it you tend to stop running.""
Had the Soviets got to the Moon first it is unlikely that they would have abandoned it as swiftly as the Americans.
Not being a democracy may have enabled the USSR to spend money and marshal the talents of their population in a way that America could not.
Space historian Dr Christopher Riley believes that not only would the Soviet Union have continued with Moon missions, but they might also have built lunar bases.
And he believes that the Americans would have been compelled to do the same and even try to continue to outdo their communist rivals.
""The history that followed in the decades afterwards would have been completely different,"" he says.
In the summer of 1969, when the Apollo 11 crew were on their way to the Moon, US vice-president, Spiro Agnew declared that America would be on Mars by 1980. At the time, this was seen as a relatively feasible goal given how fast things had progressed in the 1960s.
""They certainly had it in their minds and on their drawing boards and there were designs of methods to get to Mars that might have been put into action in response to a Soviet landing on the Moon,"" says Dr Riley.
So how close were we to following this alternative reality?
Quite close, according to Piers Bizony: ""Those who imagine Apollo had the Moon race to itself are wrong,"" he says.
The US seemed to have taken the lead in 1968 when it successfully boosted three astronauts into lunar orbit with its Apollo 8 mission.
But the Americans rushed ahead with that mission because they were afraid that the Soviet Union was about to beat them yet again and pull off another space coup.
The USSR was using a rocket called the Proton which is still in use today. The Soviets were sending payloads into space with a view to putting a cosmonaut into a so-called circumlunar flight which would take him around the Moon and straight home again without going into orbit.
They had flown an unmanned mission a few months before Apollo 8 that had taken just such a trajectory around Earth's natural satellite.
The Soviets had also built their own Moon rocket (known as the N-1) and their own lunar lander.
So how did the Americans win?
The first seeds were sown in 1957 by President Eisenhower following the launch of the first satellite by the USSR.
The launch of Sputnik 1 generated fear across the US - and a quiet realisation that the country had fallen technologically behind the Soviet Union.
President Dwight Eisenhower's response was to increase the budget for education to raise the academic standard in universities across America.
Dr Riley comments: ""To increase the brainpower they'd need to pull off these technological feats to take on the Russians and win.""
Eisenhower also commissioned the Saturn V rockets, principally to launch multi-tonne satellites for spying. But when President Kennedy inherited the White House and had to respond to Gagarin's flight, the Saturn V was already in development.
It was the Saturn V rocket that enabled the US to send astronauts to the Moon.
The early Soviet Space triumphs were managed and steered by Sergei Korolev, the man who built the R7 rocket that put Sputnik and Yuri Gagarin into orbit.
But after Korolev's death in 1966, the Soviet space effort lost focus.
Because he was not there to assert his authority, there was not one Soviet attempt to reach the Moon, but several rival schemes to reach the Moon.
According to Piers Bizony, the rival schemes sucked resources from each other: ""There was a great deal of confusion in the Soviet space effort in the late 1960s and as a result they didn't have the technology to send a man to the Moon,"" he says.
Nor did they have the computing power. By today's standards the Apollo 11 onboard computer was pretty crude, but it was ahead of its time and was crucial for America's successful Moon landings.
Who might have been first to walk on the Moon in this alternative reality is anyone's guess. Yuri Gagarin died in 1968 in a plane crash and so would not have been available for any Soviet Moon shot. In any case he was too much of a national treasure to have been sent on such a risky mission.
However, if Korolev had lived a little longer and if Soviet spies had stolen US computer technology, then the Moon might well have been colonised and have been a base for international manned missions to Mars and - perhaps - beyond.
But 50 years on from Gagarin's historic flight, the Russians will once again be the planet's pre-eminent space-faring nation. This year, the US will retire its space shuttle fleet, its only craft capable of sending astronauts into space.
According to Mr Bizony: ""America has no clear idea of what will replace the shuttle and no clear idea of whether as a nation they are truly committed to the human spaceflight adventure.
""Meanwhile Russia will be flying American astronauts and those from other countries on board their Soyuz capsule. And that Soyuz lifts on a rocket very similar in its essential construction to the one that launched Yuri Gagarin.""",The Americans won the race to the Moon when Neil Armstrong set foot on the lunar surface in 1969.,13041326
400,"One of the five men said they were kept shackled in a cave with little food for much of the time and their drinking water was contaminated by worms.
The men were working for a South Korean construction company and were building a road north of Mazar-e-Sharif when they were seized in December.
They arrived in Dhaka on Sunday.
One worker was shot dead and two others were released almost immediately.
The terms of their release have not been disclosed.
Correspondents say that insurgents often target government projects such as roads because they are seen to be symbols of the central government which they reject.
""When they first took us, it was winter. And they kept us in small rooms in a house. We were only allowed out once a day, at night. All we had to eat was bread,""  Mohammad Aminul Islam told the BBC's Bengali service on arrival in Dhaka on Sunday.
""When spring came, they took us to a mountain and they dug a cave and kept us there. We were always shackled. They gave us two litres of water each a day. There were worms in the water which we filtered before drinking.""
Mr Islam said the Taliban would not say exactly why they were targeted.
""The militants used to say that, as fellow Muslims, the Bangladeshis should not be working for the Americans,"" he said.
The Taliban also complained that the work the team was doing in building roads was making it more difficult for the insurgents to plant roadside bombs.
Bangladesh's foreign minister said the Afghan government and the South Korean company were involved in the release.
It is not clear whether a ransom was paid.
In April, Taliban insurgents released 12 Iranian and Afghan engineers kidnapped while working in a remote area of western Afghanistan.
The men were employed on a road-building project in Farah province when they were taken by gunmen.

401,"The goal is to radically reduce the amount of time it takes to send stock to health clinics in the African nation by road or other means.
The scheme involves Zipline, a Silicon Valley start-up that began running a similar service in Rwanda in October.
Experts praised that initiative but cautioned that ""cargo drones"" are still of limited use to humanitarian bodies.
The Department for International Development (Dfid) has not said how much money will be invested in the Tanzanian effort or for how long.
It also announced plans to fund tests of drones in Nepal to map areas of the country prone to damage from extreme weather, so help prepare for future crises.
""This innovative, modern approach ensures we are achieving the best results for the world's poorest people and delivering value for money for British taxpayers,"" commented the International Development Secretary Priti Patel.
Zipline's drones - called Zips - are small fixed-wing aircraft that are fired from a catapult and follow a pre-programmed path using GPS location data.
The advantage of the design over multi-rotor models is that the vehicles can better cope with windy conditions and stay airborne for longer. In theory, they can fly up to about 180 miles (290km) before running out of power, although Zipline tries to keep round trips to about half that distance.
Their drawback is that they require open space to land - in Zip's case an area about the size of two car parking slots.
Zipline gets round this issue by having its drones descend to heights of about 5m (16.4ft) when they reach their destinations and then release their loads via paper parachutes. Afterwards, they regain altitude and return to base before coming to rest.
The aircraft fly below 500ft (152m) to avoid the airspace used by passenger planes.
Tanzania, Rwanda and Malawi - which uses a different type of drone for medical deliveries - all take a permissive approach to unmanned aerial vehicle [UAV] regulations, helping make them attractive places for such trials.
Earlier in the year, Tanzania also authorised the use of drones in its Tarangire National Park as part of an effort to deter animal poachers.
Dfid estimates that flying blood and medical supplies by drone from out of Tanzania's capital, Dodoma, could save $58,000 (£47,400) a year compared to sending them by car or motorcycle.
But a spokeswoman suggested that the time savings were more crucial.
""Flights are planned to start in early 2017, and when they do it is estimated that [the] UAVs could support over 50,000 births a year, cutting down the time mothers and new-borns would have to wait for life-saving medicine to 19 minutes - reduced from the 110 minutes traditional transport methods would take,"" she explained.
The Ifakara Health Institute - which specialises in treatments for malaria, HIV, tuberculosis as well as neonatal health issues - will be the local partner.
The Humanitarian UAV Network and other non-profit bodies recently surveyed the use of drones to carry out human welfare tasks.
The study highlighted the work Zipline was doing, noting the firm was  capable of setting up a new drones launch hub in as little as 24 hours, meaning it was well suited to rapid response efforts as well as longer-term projects.
But the study also noted that humanitarian cargos are often measured in tonnes rather than kilograms, and need to be transported across longer distances than a Zip can manage.
""Given these current trade-offs relative to manned aviation, the specific cases in which cargo drones can currently add value are particularly narrow in the context of the universe of needs that humanitarian organisations typically face,"" it said.
And it added that more research was needed to properly evaluate whether existing schemes were as reliable as claimed.
""Organisations considering the use of cargo drones need statistics on flights performed, hours logged, failure rates and other performance measures.""",The UK government is to fund a trial of drone-based deliveries of blood and other medical supplies in Tanzania.,38450664

It is the first time since 1991 Aberdeen have won their opening three league matches of the season and last year's runners-up are playing with an air of confidence and authority, a consequence of the winning habit they have developed.
This was a big win for them, with Motherwell proving testing opponents in a fabulously entertaining match.
Both sides possess players with terrific pace, which added to the absorbing, end-to-end nature of the contest. Indeed, the opening goal owed much to Motherwell's counter-attacking ability.
Lionel Ainsworth broke with lightening speed to feed Scott McDonald and the Australian forward's powerful shot was pushed away by Danny Ward. The ball then fell for Johnson, who volleyed into the ground and past the keeper.
Aberdeen's equaliser came in bizarre fashion as McGinn curled in a cross from the left and as players from both sides tried and failed to get a touch, the ball crept past the flat-footed Connor Ripley and in off the far post.
Both sides contributed hugely to a frenetic game but Aberdeen will feel they deserved the win, having dominated possession and creating more danger for the opposing keeper.
David Goodwillie should perhaps have headed them in front just after the interval, but Taylor did exactly that in the 62nd minute.
McGinn swept in a free kick from the left and Taylor rose to plant a firm header into the net as Ripley came off his line and failed to get anywhere near the cross.
The busy McGinn almost put the game beyond Motherwell with a terrific run and shot, which on this occasion came back off an upright.
The high tempo continued in the closing stages but Motherwell could not fashion another opportunity to seriously test Ward as the large visiting support went home delighted.

404,"The plan is said to include a demand for Greece's debt to be cut by up to 30%, after voters rejected the terms of an international bailout on Sunday.
Athens has been urged to make ""serious"" proposals as Greece risks defaulting on its €323bn ($356bn; £228bn) debt.
Greece's banks are to stay closed on Tuesday and Wednesday.
The European Central Bank (ECB) is maintaining its pressure on Greek banks, refusing to increase emergency lending and ordering them to provide more security for existing emergency loans.
Follow the latest updates
Eurozone finance ministers will meet in Brussels later on Tuesday before a full summit of eurozone leaders.
Mr Tsipras may be prepared to accept many of the demands made by Greece's creditors, the BBC's Chris Morris in Athens reports.
But - emboldened by his resounding win in the referendum - Mr Tsipras also wants the more gradual implementation of some reforms and substantial debt relief, reports say.
Following a meeting on Monday, the leaders of all Greek parties except the communists and far-right Golden Dawn party released a joint statement insisting that the country should stay in the eurozone.
""The recent verdict of the Greek people is not a mandate for rupture, but a mandate to continue and strengthen the effort to reach a socially fair and economically viable deal,"" the statement said.
Central to any negotiations will be new Greek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos, who replaced outspoken Yanis Varoufakis on Monday.
Mr Tsakalotos has admitted he is nervous and worried about the crisis, but said Greece deserved a better deal.
French Prime Minister Manuel Valls says the eurozone could not ""take the risk of Greece leaving"". He told French radio: ""The basis for a deal exists.""
However, Germany earlier warned against any unconditional write-off of Greece's debt, saying it would destroy the single currency.
""I really hope that the Greek government - if it wants to enter negotiations again - will accept that the other 18 member states of the euro can't just go along with an unconditional haircut [debt write-off],"" said German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel.
Speaking at the European parliament in Strasbourg, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said the ""ball lies in the court of the Greek government and it must explain in Brussels today how it sees ourselves extricating ourselves from the current situation"".
What happens next?
Meanwhile, the ECB said it would keep emergency cash support for Greek banks, which are running out of funds and on the verge of collapse, at the same level - refusing requests for additional support.
It told the banks to lodge more collateral - or assets - with the Bank of Greece, reducing the amount of spare cash the banks have.
Greece's Economy Minister, Giorgios Stathakis, had earlier told the BBC that the ECB had to keep Greek banks alive for seven to 10 days so that negotiations could take place.
Last week, Greece ordered banks to close after the ECB froze its financial lifeline following the breakdown of bailout talks in Brussels.
Capital controls have been imposed, with people unable to withdraw more than €60 a day from cash points.
With pressure growing on the Greek banking system, the eurozone summit will have to give a pretty clear signal that it thinks progress can be made.
But the two most important leaders in the eurozone, Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande, appear to be struggling to find a common position on Greece in the wake of Sunday's ""No"" vote.
Broadly speaking, some countries - led by France - are pushing for a deal that will give Greece some breathing space to stay in the eurozone.
Others - led by Germany - are under greater political pressure at home, and wonder whether such a deal is possible.
It all leaves Greece in the most precarious position it has experienced in five years of wrenching economic crisis. The best that can be said is that it could go either way.

405,"Okay, okay but before you nod off, it is worth pointing out this is a vital issue which goes to the heart of new powers for Scotland.
The Scotland Bill, currently making its way through Westminster, stands to transform Holyrood into one of the world's most powerful devolved parliaments - or so we're told by the UK government.
Edinburgh is on course to gain major new tax and welfare powers - but that's currently being overshadowed by a debate about whether it can be done fairly.
At the moment, most of Scotland's £30bn annual budget is funded by the UK Treasury - known as the block grant - and the amount of cash which goes into the pot is worked out under the Barnett Formula.
Once Holyrood gets more power to raise its own tax money, the amount of Barnett cash which comes north of the border will be cut.
Year One of these powers is straightforward enough - if you get £10bn worth of cash-raising powers, £10bn is then deducted from the block grant.
But things start getting complicated in future years, where tax policy in Scotland and the rest of the UK could begin to look very different.
The Smith Commission, set up by UK ministers to agree which new powers should be transferred from Westminster to Scotland, said the final solution shouldn't put Scotland, or the rest of the UK, at a disadvantage.
But some argue that's a near impossible task.
Economist Prof David Bell, said: ""Neither side will be entirely happy - one will probably be more unhappy than the other.
""It's not clear which way it would go and there's none which I would say is demonstrably superior.""
Prof Bell, of Stirling University, has just co-authored a report by the IFS economic think tank, which has looked at various ways of adjusting the block grant.
Each has its pros and cons - and getting your brain around the economic theory isn't easy.
But one way would be linking the block grant level to economic performance.
Prof Bell explained: ""If Scotland manages to grow its tax revenues faster than in the rest of the UK, it will be able to expand its budget relative to the rest of the UK.
""If its tax revenues don't grow as fast, then the likelihood is that the Scottish budget will contract a bit.
""And then there's arguments about whether that should be adjusted for population and how it should be adjusted on a yearly basis, and so on.""
To focus on the more straightforward conclusions of the IFS report, not only does it say it cannot be guaranteed that new powers will cause no detriment to Scottish and UK budgets, but failure to find an appropriate funding mechanism could cost Scotland £1bn a year.
Separately, the economist and Glasgow University Principal Anton Muscatelli, writing in The Herald newspaper, warned a bad deal could leave Scotland hundreds of millions of pounds worse off within a few years.
All this has prompted the House of Lords - which is currently poring over the Scotland Bill to deliver new Holyrood powers - to call for a delay until the fiscal framework can be agreed.
Lord Hollick, of the Lords Economic Affairs Committee, said: ""Until we know what the rules are, we simply don't have a clue about how this will impact the government of Scotland, the government of the rest of the UK and the people of Scotland and the UK.""
The UK and Scottish governments are committed to keeping the Barnet Formula - which partly allocates money based on population - despite much debate over the years on replacing it.
The political scientist, Prof Michael Keating, has a view on the ultimate outcome - and because politicians are involved, you've probably heard this one before.
""It will be a political compromise - it always is,"" said the Aberdeen University academic, adding: ""They'll get something in between and then they'll give it a name, like the Barnett Formula.
""A lot of people said we should have a formula based on need, and you raise some of your own revenue.
""But politicians have shied away from that one, and they're going to back away from it this time, because they'll never find it easy to agree what that formula should be.
""So we'll get a messy fudge.""
Meanwhile, talks over Scotland's fiscal framework are being conducted behind closed doors between the Scottish and UK governments.
Scottish ministers aren't keen on a delay but, at the same, say they won't approve anything which doesn't deliver a fair deal.
UK ministers say they're committed to exactly that - but it does look like talks over Scotland's new funding deal will go on for a while yet.",Let's talk about Scotland's new fiscal framework.,34889958
406,"Finding Your Roots, similar to the BBC's Who Do You Think You Are?, researches celebrity family histories.
A review into an episode, which aired in October, concluded Affleck lobbied producers about ditching details about his slave-owning ancestors.
PBS said it plans to hire a fact-checker and an independent genealogist.
Following its investigation, PBS concluded producers violated network standards by allowing Batman star Affleck to have ""improper influence"" and ""by failing to inform PBS or [New York TV station] WNET of Mr. Affleck's efforts to affect programme content"".
The public service broadcaster said it would not commit to a fourth season of the series ""until we are satisfied that the editorial standards of the series have been successfully raised to a level in which we can have confidence"".
Affleck's request to omit details about a slave-owning relative from the show came to light with the publication of hacked Sony emails between the series host, Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr, and Sony Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton.
The details were eventually left out of the show.
""I lobbied him the same way I lobby directors about what takes of mine I think they should use,"" Affleck wrote on Facebook, when the email exchange came to light earlier this year.
""I didn't want any television show about my family to include a guy who owned slaves. I was embarrassed,"" the actor said.
At the time, Gates defended his editorial choices: ""Ultimately, I maintain editorial control on all of my projects and, with my producers, decide what will make for the most compelling program. In the case of Mr. Affleck - we focused on what we felt were the most interesting aspects of his ancestry,"" he said in a statement, released in April this year.
In a statement released on Wednesday, Gates thanked PBS for its ""thoughtful internal review"".
""I sincerely regret not discussing my editing rationale with our partners at PBS and WNET, and I apologise for putting PBS and its member stations in the position of having to defend the integrity of their programming.""
The third series of the show will be delayed to ensure ""improved editorial and production processes"", PBS said in their statement.
It added that the episode in which Affleck's ancestry is examined will be withdrawn from all forms of distribution, including digital streaming and DVD.","US broadcaster, PBS, is postponing its third series of Finding Your Roots, after the show omitted ""embarrassing"" details about Ben Affleck's ancestry.",33267697
407,"Percy F Westerman's children's adventure stories of ""daring do"" sold more than 1.5m copies in the early 20th Century.
Academics and enthusiasts are gathering for a weekend seminar in the city.
Organiser Nigel Gossop said: ""He has been forgotten in a city awash with literary greats.""
When Percy Westerman began writing in 1908, his stories were so-called ""ripping yarns"" - tales of gung-ho adventurers, spies and explorers.
He became one of the UK's most popular adventure writers for the next five decades, publishing 174 books.
Tales like The Flying Submarine, Wilmshurst of the Frontier, and Deeds of Pluck and Daring in the Great War led to him being voted ""Most Popular Boys' Author"" in a Daily Sketch poll in the 1930s.
His short stories and serials were published in popular children's magazines of the time, like Boy's Own Paper and Chums.
Despite his popularity, the writer and his works have slipped into obscurity since his death in 1959.
Mr Gossop admitted ""the language hasn't travelled well"" with representations of foreigners and indigenous populations now appearing very outdated.
""I don't think it's offensive,"" he said.
""Its just they are almost historical documents now, reflecting the social context of the time.""
""A lot were written during World War I. So all the Germans are very sinister with spiky helmets and are referred to as 'the hun',"" he said.
The genre has been much parodied - former Monty Python stars Terry Jones and Michael Palin's Ripping Yarns series of the mid-1970s sent up the style with spoof adventures like ""Across the Andes by Frog"".
Michael Palin has told Mr Gossop that although Percy F Westerman's stories were not the direct basis for the series, ""[his] was a name we were all brought up with"".
In Portsmouth, which claims Arthur Conan-Doyle, Charles Dickens and Rudyard Kipling among its famous literary former residents, Mr Gossop said he was disappointed Westerman had been overlooked for a blue plaque on his former home.
In contrast to Charles Dickens, whom Mr Gossop points out only lived in the city for the first two years of his life, Westerman lived in the city for 34 years.
Dom Kippin, Portsmouth City Council's literature development officer, said there were ""no immediate plans"" for a plaque in the city dedicated to Percy F Westerman.
He added: ""Portsmouth has been home to many great writers over the years.
""Our work with creative writing and literacy projects should ensure that the legacy of writers like Westerman lives on in the city.""
Mr Gossop described Westerman as ""certainly a quirky guy"". He was a stickler for discipline and a keen supporter of the Sea Scouts.
Westerman later moved to Wareham, in Dorset, where he lived on a barge on the River Frome and commanded the local Home Guard unit during World War II.
Mr Gossop has been researching Westerman for about 10 years and has amassed a collection of about 200 books.
He is now in touch with other fans around the world as Westerman's work was also published in French, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish, Polish, and Hungarian.
With the books no longer being in print, the more sought-after editions can sell for upwards of Â£50. Ten are now available as digital downloads.","Following celebrations for the 200th anniversary of Charles Dickens's birth, fans of another Portsmouth-born writer are calling for him to be recognised.",16962543

409,"Three Clinical Commissioning Groups in Worcestershire plan to only treat the most severe cases where pain interferes with daily life and ability to sleep.
Bosses said changing the scoring system to cut operations will save £2m a year.
The Royal College of Surgeons said the proposals have ""no clinical justification"".
More stories from Herefordshire and Worcestershire
Redditch and Bromsgrove, South Worcestershire, and Wyre Forest are the CCGs behind the proposals, estimated to lead to around 350 fewer operations a year.
The plans would focus on treating ""severe to the upper end of moderate"" cases, and people who are obese with a body mass index of 35 or over needing to lose 10% of their weight unless their problems were very severe.
CCG documents said a ""patient's pain and disability should be sufficiently severe that it interferes with the patient's daily life and/or ability to sleep"".
Stephen Cannon, vice president of the Royal College of Surgeons, said the scoring system used, known as the Oxford scoring system, ""should not be used to create barriers to care"".
Many local NHS commissioning groups in England are introducing these kinds of cost-cutting measures.
Harrogate, Vale of York, Shropshire and the south coast of Kent are all imposing similar restrictions on non-emergency surgery.
Some are asking patients to lose weight or stop smoking before they can be considered for an operation.
Other NHS bodies are restricting patient access to some treatments, surgery, expensive drugs and IVF.
Demand for new hips has risen across all ages groups and particularly in the under 60s, NHS figures for England show.
This is mainly because new replacements now last for much longer than before, surgeons say.
But with demand only likely to grow with an ageing population, and the money to pay for them getting increasingly scarce, NHS rationing of hip and knee replacements may well become more common.
A spokesperson for NHS Redditch and Bromsgrove CCG, on behalf of the three groups, said: ""If a patient feels that they require this surgery but do not meet these criteria, there is a clear appeals system.""
Gordon Wainwright, from Malvern, is waiting for a hip operation and said he is concerned how eligibility will be judged.
""If you are filling in the Oxford test, as we all do, if you want to get the op done you're probably going to not be totally truthful because you want to get your operation done,"" he said.",Cost-cutting plans to slash the number of people eligible for hip and knee replacements have been criticised by surgeons.,38770046

Ms Wrightson's body was found at her home in Hartlepool in December after a ""sustained and brutal assault"", Teesside Crown Court heard. Medical evidence showed she had more than 100 injuries.
The girls deny murder.
Jurors heard an array of items were used in the attack.
Nicholas Campbell QC, prosecuting, said: ""A number of implements were used as weapons. They included a wooden stick with screws standing proud of the surface, a TV set, a printer from a home computer, a coffee table and a shovel.
""Smaller items such as a kettle and a metal pan were used together with a glass vase and other ornaments.
""There were well over 100 injuries. The evidence at the scene of the crime showed she had been struck in 12 separate locations within that room.""
The court was told her blood-stained body was found by her landlord at her home in Stephen Street. She died as a result of blood loss.
Mr Campbell said: ""It became clear that Angela Wrightson had been the victim of a sustained and brutal assault.""
The younger girl took selfies at the scene and published one on Snapchat, the court was told.
Later she contacted a friend using Facebook, and that witness went on to tell police during the call she heard the defendant shout: ""Go on, smash her head in, bray her, kill her.""

412,"They were young, no older than 35. Their family home had been hit by an air strike, they said, one of thousands launched by a Saudi-led coalition that pounded the province every day that month.
The heartland of the rebel Houthi movement, Saada is among the most dangerous parts of Yemen, and the Al-Jumhori is the only emergency facility in the province — in reality, the only A&E department in most of northern Yemen.
Dr Carrara, an Argentine working for the international medical charity Medicins Sans Frontieres (MSF), triaged the married couple. The husband's injuries were minor and she turned her attention to the wife, who had severe injuries to both her arms. Nearly all the soft tissue had been stripped away by the blast.
As a surgical team prepared to amputate, Dr Carrara spoke to the woman's husband. He asked her to save his wife's arms. Their four children, all younger than 10, had been killed by the strike, he told her.
""We have lost our children,"" he said. ""Please do everything you can.""
Since March, when the US-backed coalition launched a military campaign to defeat the Houthis, some 6,000 people — almost half of them civilians — have been killed in air strikes and fighting on the ground in Yemen, according to the UN.
In January, a leaked UN report accused the coalition of ""widespread and systematic"" attacks against civilians. The coalition says it greatly regrets civilian deaths, which it insists are unintentional.
The coalition is attempting to restore the internationally-recognised government of President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi, who was forced into exile by the rebels last March, but the conflict has taken a bloody toll on the country's civilians and ravaged an already fragile health system.
Three MSF facilities and one ambulance have been hit by air strikes, killing at least eight people and depriving hundreds of thousands of access to emergency care — despite the charity providing their co-ordinates to all sides.
With precious few A&E facilities left functioning, Al-Jumhori has expanded from a small facility into a 93-bed hospital treating 2,000 emergency cases a month and performing more than 100 surgeries a week.
""I'd never before seen the level of casualties I saw in Saada,"" Michael Seawright, an MSF project coordinator, said in January after a stint in the province.
""The scale of wounded was extreme in two respects - firstly there was a large number of wounded coming through the hospital, but second the severity of wounds was also often extreme.""
And the bombs have other crippling effects, beyond their blast radius. They discourage many casualties from even attempting to reach a facility, said Teresa Sancristobal, MSF's emergency co-ordinator for Yemen.
""The perception is that the medical facilities are not safe. A lot of times when we ask patients why they didn't come sooner, they tell us they were afraid,"" she said.
For Yemen's civilians, getting to a medical facility equipped to cope with severe trauma can be hellishly difficult. It can involve an hours-long journey by car, fraught with danger from flying bullets and falling missiles.
On Thursday, a young pregnant woman arrived at Al-Jumhori with 60% of her body burned. Like so many who come through the hospital's doors, her home had been hit by an air strike, this one in the heavily-targeted Razeh district of Saada province, close to the border with Saudi Arabia.
With travel too risky, the woman was forced to wait for a week before her family could take her to a nearby clinic. From there she was moved by ambulance to the Al-Jumhori, a five-hour journey.
""I could not imagine how much pain she was in,"" said Dr Carrara. ""By the time she reached us she was septic and had severe organ failure. We did what we could but there was no hope."" The woman died 16 hours later. She was in her 20s.
If she had made it to Saada city within eight hours, she and her child could almost certainly have been saved.
Patients arriving at MSF facilities in Yemen are immediately graded with one of four colours: green denotes that they are walking wounded; yellow that they must be seen within an hour; red that they need immediate resuscitation; black that they are already dead, or have no hope.
""We grade a lot of people black and red,"" said Dr Carrara. ""Most of them are young. They have crash injuries, vascular injuries, fractures, open fractures on the legs and arms, head trauma, penetrating head trauma, abdominal trauma, chest trauma, open chest trauma, blunt trauma.
""Air strikes cause multiple, severe injuries. They put people in critical condition.""
The first day we spoke, a family of seven was rushed in to Dr Carrara's A&E. Five — the mother, father, and three children — were immediately graded black. Two boys were alive. The older of the two, aged 20, was graded green — he would survive. The younger boy, aged just eight, was graded red. He had a penetrating head trauma and was in a coma.
When we spoke again the following day, the boy's condition had deteriorated. He will probably die.
Emergencies are not the difficult part of treating the war-wounded, said Dr Carrara. The difficulty comes later, as she follows them through their recovery — ""sometimes 10 days, sometimes a month, sometimes more"".
""That is when you hear their stories, what happened to them, who they lost. That's when I wonder how they can continue. And that's when it gets difficult."" At what point does it become too much? ""It doesn't,"" she said. ""You do what you have to. You do the work, that gets you through.""
An average day for an MSF doctor in Yemen would be too much for most. Last year, while Saada city was being bombed daily, the medical team at Al-Jumhori — a mix of MSF staff and Yemenis — were working 16-hour days and snatching naps on a handful of shared mattresses in the basement, the risk of leaving the hospital too great.
Dr Carrara's few hours downstairs were usually interrupted by emergency calls, up to four or five per night. The warning system for an emergency is often primitive: the hospital's doors and windows vibrate. A bomb has landed nearby.
""When you feel the ground shake, you know that patients are coming,"" she said.
In January, a missile hit the Shiara emergency room, an MSF facility in nearby Razeh district. Six people, including three members of the medical staff, were killed and seven more severely injured. The hospital was destroyed.
MSF says it does everything in its power to identify its staff and facilities to Yemen's warring factions, but there is only so much it can do.
""The situation is very difficult, the insecurity is clear,"" Ms Sancristobal said. ""Hospitals have to be a place where patients feel safe. We don't understand how we could have had so many attacks.""
The coalition promised in January to conduct a review into the strikes on MSF facilities and set up a ""hotline"" with the charity. Ms Sancristobal said she did not know what the coalition meant by ""hotline"" — MSF has been communicating its positions since the beginning of the conflict.
""The communication is good, the results are bad,"" she said.
In Syria, where two hospitals suffered direct air strikes last week, MSF has been forced to take a startling and opposite tack: withholding the GPS co-ordinates of its facilities from the Syrian and Russian militaries over fears they are being deliberately targeted.
Dr Carrara is preparing to leave Yemen. In Saada city, things are beginning to improve — it is safe enough for the medical staff to live in a house opposite the hospital, although they still do not go out, only shuttle between the two buildings.
The hospital is open again for inpatients, meaning people with chronic illnesses can again seek treatment. Women are delivering babies on the wards again, every day, and staying the night.
It does not take Dr Carrara long to recall the moment that meant the most to her. One morning last October, shortly after returning to Yemen, she arrived for her shift and noticed a woman sitting quietly in the waiting area, her face covered by a veil.
She asked a nurse what the woman was waiting for. ""She's waiting for you,"" the nurse replied. It was the woman whose arms had been so badly wounded in May, whose four young children had died.
Just as her husband had asked, the hospital staff had done everything they could — a massive operation to close her wounds, months of dressing her arms every day under sedation because the pain was so intense. And on top of all that, treatment for the malaria she contracted during her recovery.
""What stayed with me was that she had never once complained, never,"" Dr Carrara said. ""This woman who lost her four children, she didn't complain when she arrived, she didn't complain when she was treated, she didn't complain during her recovery. Her bravery... I couldn't understand how.""
That morning, in the waiting area at the hospital, she was alive and well. She had lost three fingers but only a small amount of movement in her arms. She was managing her daily activities, she said. She was coping. It was more than the doctors who had stood with her on the same spot six months before could have hoped.
Dr Carrara has an understated way of describing things — perhaps it is just the effort of using a second language — but her voice thickens a little with emotion as she remembers.
""It was difficult to talk, I don't speak Arabic. The nurse translated for us. She had come to say thank-you. It was nice. It was so nice.""","Mariela Carrara was just days into her posting as an emergency doctor at the Al-Jumhori hospital in Saada, northern Yemen last May when a husband and wife were rushed into the building.",35608328

The book was given to Nancy Harrison by her husband Jim while he was serving in North Africa in 1943.
A hand-written message reads: ""With love to Nancy, in remembrance of our wedding day, 14th September 1938.""
The book also contains a clipping of a love poem and other hand-written notes detailing key dates, such as the births of the couple's two children, and the marriages of other couples in the Ryedale community.
Mrs Angell, who works at St Barnabas House, Henfield, said the book was donated to the shop on Good Friday.
She said it was while she was looking through it she noticed the notes and poem.
""I felt privileged to read it because it was so touching, and decided to share it with the Silversurfer community on Facebook,"" she said.

418,"On the one hand, there's the confidence and excitement associated with being part of the famous race's 'first family', whose list of achievements include sending out last year's winner, Ballabriggs.
However, on the other, he will be without his legendary father, Ginger, trainer of Red Rum, and a towering figure at Aintree over five decades, who died in September.
Media playback is not supported on this device
""There'll be one big piece missing, and that's Dad,"" he said, ""but you wouldn't have to go very far around Aintree to see reminders of him here, there and everywhere, so will he be missing? I don't know.""
A specially-commissioned statue of Ginger is to be unveiled by the McCains on the first of the three days of the Grand National Festival, underlining his place in Aintree's rich history.
First there was Red Rum and his unrivalled position in public affections, gained with three wins and two second places in the world's most famous steeplechase during the 1970s.
Then, nearly 20 years later, when many thought Ginger's big-time days were over, he produced one of Aintree's great, romantic stories, when saddling a record-equalling fourth winner in Amberleigh House.
And just 12 months ago, he looked on proudly in the winners' enclosure as his son kept up the family tradition with the success of Ballabriggs.
Speaking at the stables on the Cholmondsley Castle estate, Cheshire, established by Ginger after he moved from a tiny yard famously adjacent to Southport beach, McCain junior said: ""It was very, very special.
""You couldn't describe what Aintree meant to Dad, and one of the satisfying things is knowing that he got to see another Grand National winner out of everything he'd put together.""
Media playback is not supported on this device
Admitting that not having a Grand National runner would give him ""an empty feeling"", the trainer is planning a two-pronged assault this year as Ballabriggs is joined by Weird Al.
""It is the greatest test of a thoroughbred racehorse on the planet,"" he said, in a tone laced with more than a hint of his colourful late father.
""It is not about class. It is about toughness, durability, professionalism and heart. You've your Derbys, you've your Gold Cups, but this is the greatest test.""
And nearing the conclusion of his most prolific season to date, with a whopping 140-plus winners, McCain's pride at having two chances of more Aintree glory is plain as we chat.
He said: ""We've only ever wanted to be around nice horses as a family.
""We've never spent money on flash cars or flash houses, and things like that, we've wanted to be around nice horses and we're in a position to be there which is very satisfying.""
Ballabriggs's 2011 win came in the most controversial of Grand Nationals, in which two horses died, a race that sparked a safety review and some modifications.
McCain believes the changes won't ""make a huge amount of difference"" to the race, but hopes that ""we can draw a line in the sand, and say this is the Grand National, now leave it alone"".
Ginger's response would perhaps have been a little more earthy, but Donald's thoughts were delivered with no less zeal. The McCain family's Aintree baton is in safe hands.

The period TV drama, which was a hit around the world, ended at Christmas 2015 after six series.
There has been much speculation about a movie version.
Swift said: ""There is a film script which we've all been sent but it disappeared in a Mission Impossible-stylee from our emails. With a little puff.""
He said ""logistics"" were causing a problem with filming and that Downton's success had meant that some cast members had ""flown off into the world"" to work on other projects.

Heather Peacock, from West Bridgford, who went into coma following the crash in 2015, said this would be a mistake.
Dr James Hopkinson, clinical lead at one CCG, said the measures were about getting ""best value"" for patients.
Ms Peacock was in a coma for eight weeks following the accident on 1 April which, along with her brain injury, left her with limited movement down her left side.
The 24-year-old, who has been receiving care at Nottingham's City Hospital, said the part of the proposals involved providing only 16 weeks of outpatient care for people with brain injuries.
""I'm very worried about future patients... I want everyone to get the amount of great care and support that I received,"" she said.
""I've been going back to outpatients for a year now and it has only been in the last few weeks that I have improved quite dramatically.""
Seven hospital-based services, including neurology assessment and brain injury care, could be affected if the proposals go ahead.
The local CCG groups said those services based at Nottingham University Hospitals (NUH) could be delivered in the community, closer to patients' homes.
Dr Hopkinson said: ""We're aiming to ensure all those services are fit for purpose and meets the patients' needs and give the best value for money for the public and taxpayer.""
The Health Service Journal said it had seen a leaked document to staff that said 13 services would be decommissioned by the CCGs this year.

426,"But historically, the totemic benchmark of the quality of service provided by hospitals is the number of people waiting for surgery and how long they have to wait.
Waiting times for non-urgent surgery were the subject of fierce political debate for much of the last two decades, but recently they faded in importance as targets have been met.
That could now be changing as waiting lists grow longer in the different health systems across the UK and the human cost of delayed surgery becomes more apparent.
Media and political attention has focused on the four-hour benchmark for being treated or assessed in A&E.
The King's Fund think tank believes the number of patients waiting for operations in England will soon top four million - for the first time in nearly a decade -  and that could prove to be the tipping point for public and political opinion.
Cutting waiting lists was a key promise by New Labour ahead of its election victory in 1997.  Remember the pledge card brandished by Tony Blair and his colleagues?
Labour delivered its policy of reducing numbers waiting for operations by 100,000, and then, in 2008, went further by introducing the 18-week target.
That established a right for patients to start consultant-led treatment within 18 weeks of being referred by a GP, with a benchmark of 92% of patients seen in that time.
The 18-week target and fines regime, which was refined in 2012, was widely seen as an effective incentive to hospitals to cut waiting times for patients.
Hospitals on average managed to hit and exceed the 92% standard, but that all changed in early 2016 when performance slipped below that target.
Analysis of NHS England data reveals that the number of patients waiting more than 18 weeks for non-urgent surgery has more than doubled in the four years to November 2016.
That is a much faster rate of increase that the number who start treatment in under 18 weeks and faster still than the rate of growth of NHS operations across the board.
Hospital chiefs and health experts say increasing waiting times are an inevitable consequence of NHS budgets lagging behind increases in patient demand.
When emergency admissions are rising, and with a finite number of beds, something has to give.
Delayed transfers of care make the task of finding beds even harder. Patients waiting for routine surgery and procedures are the ones who lose out.
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have different target regimes for waiting lists.
All have seen sharp increases in the number of long waits between 2012 and 2016.
Wales has not hit its target since 2010 and the NHS in Scotland has been adrift since June 2014.
The pressures on resources and the ability to deliver timely routine treatment are similar across the UK.
Without an injection of more cash it is hard to see how the waiting list situation will improve, given the stresses and strains on all forms of care across the NHS.
Cancellations of routine surgery over Christmas and early January will contribute to the deterioration.
Waiting lists are still a lot shorter than at the worst points in the 1990s and at times over the following decade.
But the question now is whether patients begin to feel that what they get from their local hospital, unless they are seriously ill, is falling well short of their expectations.",There are many indicators against which patients can judge the performance of the NHS.,38859225
427,"The channel will have a budget of £30m, equivalent to the amount spent on BBC4.
The plans for the channel include a Scottish news hour at 9pm which will broadcast stories from Scotland, the UK and the world.
The director-general also announced an increase of about £20m a year for Scotland to make UK-wide programmes.
The BBC's Scotland editor Sarah Smith on the new ""Scottish Nine""
Brian Taylor: It's a 'yes' to BBC Scotland's new TV channel
He said this would be focused on drama and factual programming.
The key points of the new channel - which will be called BBC Scotland - are:
Lord Hall described it as the biggest single investment in broadcast content in Scotland for more than 20 years.
Scotland should receive about £40m in new funding annually - £19m for the new channel and digital developments, and £20m for making network programmes.
It is hoped that spending on network programmes made in Scotland for a UK-wide BBC audience will rise from about £65m this year to closer to £90m over the next three years.
Lord Hall said: ""We know that viewers in Scotland love BBC television but we also know that they want us to better reflect their lives and better reflect modern Scotland.
""The best way of achieving this is a dedicated channel for Scotland.
""It's a channel that will be bold, creative and ambitious, with a brand-new Scotland-edited international news programme at its heart.""
The new BBC TV channel for Scotland will broadcast every evening and will show drama, factual, comedy and news programmes made in Scotland.
The development of a nightly news hour at 9pm means that the news output on BBC One in Scotland will remain in its current form.
There had been calls for a ""Scottish Six"", which would integrate the main BBC News at Six from London and Reporting Scotland in a news hour.
It would provide UK, Scottish and international stories from a Scottish perspective.
The proposals for a Scottish Six were in response to criticism that the News at Six often featured stories - for example on education and health - that had little relevance to Scottish audiences.
The Scottish government argued the BBC needed to ""catch up"" with devolution and to give its Scottish operation greater control of budgets, staffing and decision making.
Responding to the latest announcement, SNP MP John Nicolson said he welcomed the new channel and extra investment for Scotland.
However, he said he was ""disappointed"" the BBC had ""killed off"" the idea of separate Scottish Six news on BBC One.
He said: """"You just have to watch the running order of the main BBC news.
""Quite often they will lead on an English health story then there will be an English transport story. It will often have three English stories in its running order.
""That's great for the people of England but it is obviously not good for the people of Scotland on their main channel.""
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon used social media to react to the news. She tweeted: ""Lots to welcome in today's announcement. @scotgov has long argued for new BBC Scotland channel. Vital that it is funded well.
""Commitments to new investment and 80 additional jobs for journalists long overdue and very positive.""
But she added: ""It doesn't deliver everything that everyone wanted - e.g. no Scottish 6 disappointing - but progress and hopefully sign of new thinking.""
Scottish Conservative culture spokesman Jackson Carlaw said the move was ""good for jobs, journalism, scrutiny and programming"".
He said: ""It also ensures those who still prefer the UK-wide BBC news at 6pm, and other programming on BBC1, get to keep that too.""
Scottish Labour's Lewis Macdonald also welcomed the move and criticised Nationalist politicians for their ""interference in the BBC's impartiality"".
Paul Holleran, Scottish organiser for journalists' union The NUJ, said it was a ""shot in the arm"" for Scottish journalism.
However, he said the amount of investment ""falls well short"" of what the BBC management and unions in Scotland were looking for.
Explaining the decision to retain the current BBC One news output, a BBC spokesman said the News at Six had performed strongly in Scotland in recent years.
He went on to say that the 9pm news slot on the new channel would offer the audience choice and quality and would provide comprehensive reporting of the news from a Scottish perspective.
Lord Hall said Scotland already made network programmes such as Shetland, Two Doors Down and Still Game but it needed to make more.
He said the additional £20m for making UK-wide programmes would be a ""huge boost for BBC Scotland and for the creative industries in Scotland"".
The director-general also announced £1.2m for Gaelic channel BBC Alba, taking its budget to £20m.
The proposals will be subject to approval by the BBC's new unitary board and possibly by Ofcom.
The announcement on Scottish funding followed the BBC saying an extra £8.5m a year would be spent on programmes made in Wales.
Plans for Northern Ireland will be announced shortly.
When she took over as BBC Scotland's new director in December, Donalda MacKinnon pledged to spend more licence fee funds raised north of the border on programming produced in Scotland.
In 2015/16, 55% of licence fee funds raised in Scotland was spent on local and Scottish network content.
The BBC's 2015/16 accounts showed £320m was raised from the licence fee in Scotland. Of that, £176.5m was spent on local content and Scottish-made BBC network output.
This was a sharp decline from the £203m spend the previous year, which was 63% of the £323m collected. The funds not spent locally go towards BBC programmes developed elsewhere and aired across the UK.
The new funding takes the percentage of the licence fee funds raised in Scotland and spent in Scotland to 68% - or 79% if the £35m spent on distribution costs, getting the programmes to the audience, is included.
In comparison, 95% of licence fee funds raised in Wales in 2015/16 were spent in Wales - including on network-wide programmes like Doctor Who, Sherlock, Casualty and Crimewatch - with the figure for Northern Ireland standing at 74%.","A new TV channel for the BBC in Scotland will begin broadcasting in autumn 2018, director-general Tony Hall has announced.",39042666

Chelsea's Premier League rivals Liverpool were also interested in Salah and held talks with Basel.
But he became Blues manager Jose Mourinho's third signing in the January transfer window, following the arrivals of Nemanja Matic and Bertrand Traore.
His signing comes after Chelsea sold midfielder Juan Mata to Manchester United for £37.1m on Saturday and will offer Mourinho a further attacking option, after Kevin De Bruyne's move to Wolfsburg.
Salah, who can operate in a variety of attacking roles, has been tracked by a number of clubs after impressive displays in the Europa League last term and in this season's Champions League.
He scored against Chelsea in the semi-finals of the Europa League in 2013, before netting in both Champions League matches against them this season.
""First of all, he won't score against Chelsea - which is a good thing,"" Mourinho said.
Mohamed Salah has scored in each of his past three appearances against Chelsea
""But, speaking seriously, we had to react to the Mata situation. We had to go for a young player, for a left-footed player and for a fast player - especially who is fast in the space because most of my attacking players are fast and fast with the ball.
""Salah is a kind of player that looks for the space and tries to get behind people so we think he was a good choice.""
After starting his career at Egyptian side El Mokawloon, Salah moved to Basel in 2012 and scored five league goals in 29 appearances as they secured a fourth league title in as many seasons.
His form this season has helped Basel to top spot in their domestic league ahead of its resumption after a winter break.
Salah, who made his Egypt debut in 2011, finished as joint-top goalscorer in Africa's World Cup qualifying groups with six goals.

433,"The giant, flightless beasts that roamed South America for more than 50 million years following the demise of the dinosaurs were fearsome predators.
New research shows the birds' huge beaks could deliver swift and powerful pecks, very probably killing their victims in one blow before ripping the flesh from their bodies.
""They had the full kit,"" said palaeoscientist Steve Wroe.
""These birds had enormous beaks with big hooks on the end. But we've shown they had to use those beaks with some precision and caution,"" Dr Wroe, a researcher from the University of New South Wales, Australia, told BBC News.
Dr Wroe was part of an international team that has been investigating the predatory behaviour of these extraordinary creatures.
Referred to by scientists as phorusrhacids, the birds flourished when South America was an island continent. Ranging in height from under a metre up to three metres (3ft to 10ft), at least 18 species are known to have evolved before the animals became extinct just a few million years ago.
But because nothing on Earth today resembles the terror birds, it has been difficult to say much about their life habits.
To try to get on top of the issue, the team examined the skeleton of one particular creature called Andalgalornis.
This animal lived in northwestern Argentina about six million years ago. It was mid-sized, standing about 1.4m high (4ft 6in) and weighing about 40kg (88lb).
Like all the terror birds, its skull was big (37cm; 15in) with a deep narrow bill armed with a hawk-like hook.
The team scanned the skull to picture its internal architecture and then applied an engineering technique known as finite element analysis (FEA) to assess its capabilities.
FEA is a common approach in advanced design and manufacturing that allows engineers to test the performance of load-bearing materials.
It involves creating a computer model of the skull which can then be subjected to the sorts of forces a real skeleton would experience in different types of attack behaviour.
The results demonstrated that Andalgalornis was built to jab at its prey - in much the same way as a technical boxer might make a series of swift, targeted jabs.
Other strategies ran the risk of injury by putting the slender beak under too much stress, the team found.
""It would have used a repeated, rapid strike - a downward strike, using the neck muscles to drive that big spike on the beak into the prey and then pull back and rip,"" explained Dr Wroe.
""It was really badly adapted for grabbing an object and shaking it.""
The research is detailed in a new paper in the journal PLoS One.  Its lead author is Federico Degrange of the Museo de La Plata/CONICET in Argentina.
He commented: ""No one has ever attempted such a comprehensive biomechanical analysis of a terror bird.
""We need to figure out the ecological role that these amazing birds played if we really want to understand how the unusual ecosystems of South America evolved over the past 60 million years.""
Certainly, the terror birds would have had the opportunity to use their particular attack strategy on a remarkable array of animals.
Like the birds themselves, many other heavyweight and unusual-looking beasts emerged during South America's separation from the North.
These included giant sloths, huge armadillo-like creatures and even 3m-long rodents.

The reunion was ""a lovely surprise"", said Ms Jones, adding: ""I thought I would never see him again.

They plan to use bacteria to feed on the ""leftovers"" from the whisky making process.
This will produce butanol which can be used to fuel vehicles.
More than 90% of the stuff that comes out of a whisky distillery is not whisky. It is leftovers like draff and pot ales - both produced in the early stages of the process.
They are high in sugar and are currently used for things like fertiliser and cattle feed.
Napier University's Biofuel Research Centre (BfRC) has already shown that the right bacteria can feed on those by-products to produce butanol - a direct replacement for vehicle fuel.
Now the spin-out company, Celtic Renewables, and independent malt whisky producer Tullibardine have signed a memorandum of understanding.
Together they will apply the process to thousands of tonnes of the distillery's leftovers.
Professor Martin Tangney, founder of Celtic Renewables, said: ""Our partnership with Tullibardine is an important step in the development of a business which combines two iconic Scottish industries - whisky and renewables.
""This project demonstrates that innovative use of existing technologies can utilise resources on our doorstep to benefit both the environment and the economy.""
Douglas Ross, managing director of Tullibardine, which spends Â£250,000 disposing of its by-products every year, said: ""We are delighted to be partnering Celtic Renewables in this innovative venture, the obvious benefits of which are environmental.
""It takes a cost to us and turns it into something that has social as well as commercial value.""

Dr Thomas had been accused of failing to act to prevent his death, following a telephone conversation with Ryan's mother the day before he died.

Some paparazzi had gone to ""extreme lengths"" to take pictures and ""a line has been crossed"", the palace said.
It wants to ""inform discussion"" on unauthorised photography of children.
The palace said a small number of media organisations, mostly in Germany, France, Australia, New Zealand and the US, had published photos of Prince George in ""unacceptable circumstances"".
However it said the ""vast majority"", and all UK publications, had refused.
The palace says in recent months, photographers have:
It said the most recent incident, which was last week, involved a photographer who was discovered by police lying down in the boot of a rented car attempting to shoot photos outside a children's play area.
Nicholas Witchell, BBC royal correspondent
The palace hopes that by drawing attention to the way in which these photographs are being obtained, the readerships of these magazines will bring pressure to bear on the publishers to stop printing them.
It says it wants to instigate a ""public discussion"" which will help publishers of what they call ""unauthorised photos of children"" to understand their responsibilities better.
But is it realistic to expect the few publishers who rely of these photos to put principle before profit?
That remains to be seen.
Why paparazzi present problem for royals
Kensington Palace tweeted: ""The Duke and Duchess want to extend their thanks for the kind and supportive messages they have received in recent months.
""They have been delighted to share photos of their children and will continue to do so in the months and years ahead.
""Yet undercover paparazzi continue to pursue their children, selling images of Prince George to international publications.""
In the published letter, Kensington Palace communications secretary Jason Knauf said the prince had become the paparazzi's ""number one target"".
He said: ""It is of course upsetting that such tactics - reminiscent as they are of past surveillance by groups intent on doing more than capturing images - are being deployed to profit from the image of a two-year-old boy.
""In a heightened security environment such tactics are a risk to all involved.
""The worry is that it will not always be possible to quickly distinguish between someone taking photos and someone intending to do more immediate harm.""
Mr Knauf said the duke and duchess wanted Prince George and his sister Princess Charlotte ""to be free to play in public and semi-public spaces with other children without being photographed"".
They want to give their children a childhood that is ""free from harassment and surveillance"", he said.
Paddy Harverson, former communications secretary to the Duke of Cambridge, said: ""Just imagine if everywhere you went and when you took the children out to playgrounds, there were men carrying cameras, they were hiding.
""Often they don't know they're there until they see the photographs later in magazines, which are published abroad.""
The Metropolitan Police said in a statement: ""The covert actions of photographers have at times caused concerns during police protection operations when they have been considered a possible security threat.

Fund chairman Dan Friedkin said in a statement: ""We are confident that the Tanzanian authorities will investigate and prosecute those involved to the absolute full extent of the law.
""By bringing these individuals to justice, it will honour Roger's memory. We also fervently hope that it will mark the turning point in Tanzania in the fight to protect elephants and our wildlife heritage.""

The tank, which was parked outside the PM's home, was accompanied by anti-fracking campaigners wearing masks.
The group included grandmothers and their grandchildren from Lancashire, which is affected by the latest round of fracking licences.
Fracking, an underground drilling process, involves water, chemicals and sand injected into rock at high pressure.
Dame Vivienne said the threat of ""toxic, life threatening"" chemicals had led to a ""declaration of war on fracking"".

441,"Out of more than 40 million votes cast, he received 57%, defeating his main rival, a conservative cleric.
Mr Rouhani, a moderate who agreed a deal with world powers to limit Iran's nuclear programme, pledged to ""remain true"" to his promises.
The decisive victory gives him a strong mandate to seek reforms and revive Iran's ailing economy, analysts say.
The president received close to 23 million votes, Interior Minister Abdul Reza Rahmani Fazli said on state television, in an election that had an unexpectedly high turnout of about 70%.
In his first remarks after winning the poll, Mr Rouhani said on Twitter (in Persian): ""Great people of Iran, you're the winners of the election.""
His main challenger, former prosecutor Ebrahim Raisi received 38.5%, or 15.7 million votes, not enough to take the election to a second round.
Voting time had been extended by five hours on Friday, until midnight. Election officials said the extensions were due to ""requests"" and the ""enthusiastic participation of people"".
The economy seems to be the number one challenge. Mr Rouhani, 68, signed a nuclear deal between Iran, the US and other countries in 2015.
International sanctions were lifted as a result, but average Iranians say they do not feel the economic benefits in their daily lives.
While oil exports have rebounded and inflation is back at single-digits, unemployment remains high, especially among the young people.
Iran's hardliners had pulled all the stops and mobilised all their resources to bring out as many people as possible to grab the last centre of power in Iran that was not under their control, namely the executive branch.
Sensing an effort by the hardliners, supporters of President Rouhani who back his promises to steer the country toward moderation came out in big numbers too. Turnout has been unprecedented. In Tehran, five million people turned out to vote - twice as many as in 2013.
This was a revenge of the people against the hardliners who intimidated them, jailed them, executed them, drove them to exile, pushed them out of their jobs, and discriminated against women.
President Rouhani will now have a bigger mandate to push through his reforms, to put an end to extremism, to build bridges with the outside world, to put the economy back on track.
Iranians have said a resounding Yes to President Rouhani who, in recent years and particularly during the last several weeks of campaigning, promised to expand individual and political freedoms and make all those centres of power, like the Revolutionary Guard, accountable.
He also promised a moderate vision and an outward-looking Iran and, at rallies, openly attacked the conservative-dominated judiciary and security services.

But he added: ""The greatest oratory can lead us to the greatest mistakes.""
Mr McDonnell denied Labour was split and leader Jeremy Corbyn weakened by his defeat in Wednesday night's vote.
He said Mr Corbyn's decision to give MPs a free vote - rather than forcing them to back his position - was a ""breakthrough for our politics in this country"" as it had taken the issue of war ""out of the political arena"".
Shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn, son of Mr Corbyn's political mentor Tony Benn, made a direct appeal to Labour MPs to support air strikes to combat the ""fascists"" of so-called Islamic State.
His speech was greeted with applause by Conservative MPs and some on the Labour benches - but Mr Corbyn, who had earlier made a speech of his own saying David Cameron's case for war ""did not stack up"", sat in silence.
Mr McDonnell, one of Mr Corbyn's closest allies, who also opposed air strikes, said Mr Benn's speech was typical of the high standard of Commons speeches on both sides during the debate.
He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""His oratory was great. He reminded me of Tony Blair's speech taking us into the Iraq war and I am always anxious that the greatest oratory can lead us to the greatest mistakes as well.""
He dismissed the 66 Labour MPs who voted with the government as a ""small minority"" and said Mr Corbyn had the backing of the majority of Labour members, the party's national executive and the shadow cabinet.
He also condemned the abuse directed at Labour MPs who backed military action.
""We have said if they are Labour Party members we have disciplinary processes and they will take place. We cannot have intimidation in our party,"" he told Today.
Shadow Commons leader Chris Bryant said some of the abuse directed at MPs over the Syria vote had been ""beyond the pale"" and called for a review of the security arrangements for MPs' homes and offices.
He said it was a ""fundamental principle"" that MPs should be free to speak and vote ""without fear or favour"" or intimidation.
Commons Leader Chris Grayling said MPs' security arrangements ""is and will be continuing as a priority"" for the Commons' authorities.
Some Labour MPs claim to have been sent pictures of dead babies by anti-war protesters and others have been branded warmongers and ""red Tories"".
Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy, whose office was the target of anti-war protests, complained of intimidation while considering how to vote in Wednesday's debate.
Mr McDonnell denied claims there were efforts to deselect Ms Creasy, saying: ""There is no way she should be de-selected, she is an excellent MP, she has my support.""
Campaign group Stop the War, which until recently was chaired by Mr Corbyn, hit back at claims its supporters were bullying Labour MPs on social media, and said it would continue to support the Labour leader ""in every way that we can"".
In a joint statement, Stop the War chairman Andrew Murray and Convenor Lindsey German said:  ""Stop the War condemns the whining complaints from those MPs who apparently do not like being lobbied.
""If an MP is not robust enough to withstand emails and tweets, they should really not be voting for bombing other people - those who wish to be alone with their consciences would do better to consider a life of religious contemplation.
""Stop the War will continue to hold to democratic account all those MPs who vote for war.""
Former London mayor Ken Livingstone, who is co-chairing Labour's defence review, has meanwhile suggested there might be ""a few"" de-selections of sitting Labour MPs.
He told LBC radio: ""If I had an MP who had voted to bomb Syria then I would be prepared to support someone challenge him as long as they were good on a load of other issues.""

""You never feel safe. You're open to everything. There's still, and always will be, that stigma.""
Eventually, Carlos was picked up by the charity service Street Link who got him into private accommodation.
Things have got better - he says he's one of the ""lucky"" ones.  A rekindled romance means he's now living with his childhood sweetheart. After 26 years of no contact she saw him on television on a Crisis campaign and tracked him down.

Many of the detained lawyers endured weeks of interrogation. Their families have been harassed, their homes and offices raided. Some have experienced violent beatings.
Mr Gao, whose wife and children live in the US, also said he would never seek exile abroad.
He described staying in China as a ""mission"" given to him from God.
Mr Gao was convicted of subversion and placed under house arrest in 2006, during which time he claims to have been regularly detained and tortured.
He disappeared in January 2009 before reappearing in March 2010. He disappeared again soon after and was revealed to be in a Xinjiang prison in January 2012 after state media said he was being jailed for three years for probation abuse.
Mr Gao said that propaganda was broadcast via a loudspeaker in his prison cell for 68 continuous weeks.
The Chinese government is yet to respond to the interview and has not responded to other allegations of torture previously made by Mr Gao.
Mr Gao's wife, Geng He, has said that she hopes her husband's case will be raised during talks this week between US President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Washington.

447,"It follows the government's announcement of new rules on tax-free withdrawals from pension funds.
""The chancellor appears to be creating the perfect environment for a mis-selling scandal,"" said Tom McPhail of Hargreaves Lansdown.
However, the Treasury has insisted that thousands of pensioners will benefit.
From April 2015, savers will be able to dip into their pension savings when they want.
Each time they do, 25% of what they take out will be tax-free.
Under current rules, a 25% withdrawal must be taken as a single lump sum on retirement to be free of tax.
Chancellor George Osborne said: ""People who have worked hard and saved all their lives should be free to choose what they do with their money, and that freedom is central to our long-term economic plan.""
Pensions expert Tom McPhail said he supported the new freedom that savers will have.
But he warned that those who withdraw money from a pension pot and then invest it could end up with very poor returns.
""Many professionals struggle to get it right, so the idea that at least some inexperienced investors won't get it wrong is recklessly naÃ¯ve.""
He is particularly worried for those who invest without getting the help of a financial adviser.
Such advisers are regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
However, there is much less protection for people who make their own decisions to invest.
""Without regulatory oversight, when investors do run out of money - and some will - there'll be no accountability for this system failure,"" he said.
However the Treasury insisted that the reforms would be beneficial for millions of retirees.
""From next year they'll be able to access as much or as little of their defined contribution pension as they want and pass on their hard-earned pensions to their families tax free,"" said chancellor George Osborne.
""For some people an annuity will be the right choice whereas others might want to take their whole tax-free lump sum and convert the rest to drawdown.
""We've extended the choices even further by offering people the option of taking a number of smaller lump sums, instead of one single big lump sum,"" Mr Osborne said.
Pensions expert Dr Ros Altmann said the government's changes have the potential to help millions of pension savers make better use of their pension funds.
""Being free to access their money freely as they need to, rather than being forced to buy particular products, will be very popular, however people need to know that their pension provider will allow them to take advantage of the new freedoms,"" she said.
The government announced earlier this year that about 320,000 people would get the freedom to access pension pots flexibly without being hit with punitive tax rates.
Individuals will also be able to pass on their unused defined contribution funds to a nominated beneficiary when they die, rather than paying the 55% tax charge which currently applies.",New plans by the Treasury to give savers more freedom over their pension pots have been sharply criticised by an industry expert.,29606672
448,"Its starting point is in Turkmenistan, one of the most isolated and closed-for-business states in the world, before it goes through war-torn Afghanistan and then reaches two countries that are hard to describe as partners - Pakistan and India.
However, Turkmenistan insists that the pipeline's construction will start by the end of 2015.  The visit in May of Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to Ashgabat seemed to confirm this - both sides pledged to put fast track the project.
Likewise the recent visit of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Turkmenistan is also being seen as a boost to the project.
The proposed 1,735km-long (1,078-mile) pipeline will carry 33 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas a year from Galkynysh, making it one of the world's biggest onshore gas fields.
Pakistan and India will each get 42% of that volume - the rest will be purchased by Afghanistan.
The US strongly supports the pipeline plan, calling it ""a transformative project for the entire region"".
If implemented, it will help to attract much-needed investment to Afghanistan, increasing budget revenues through transit fees and contribute to the country's overall development.
The project is also crucial for India and Pakistan who are both facing severe energy shortages.
By 2020-21, demand for gas in India is expected to double and according to the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, demand for gas in Pakistan over roughly the same timeframe will be three times higher than supply.
Turkmenistan is keen to implement this project in order to diversify its export routes and decrease its dependency on China.
At the moment Beijing is the main buyer of the Turkmen gas and by 2020 it will import two times more Turkmen gas than now.
The Asian Development Bank has sponsored the feasibility study, the route has been mapped and the source field has been determined.
On the commercial side, there have been significant achievements.
TurkmenGaz, Afghan Gas Enterprise, Inter State Gas Systems (Pakistan) and GAIL (India) are all equal shareholders in the Tapi Pipeline Company which will build, own and operate the pipeline.
All countries involved in the project have signed a gas sale and purchase agreement.
This is one of the main issues that remain unresolved.
It is not clear who will finance the project that is estimated to cost $10bn.
The Pakistani and Indian governments show no indication that they can pay for the pipeline.
None of the four energy companies that formed the consortium has enough resources to fund the construction.
They have debated from the very beginning about inviting a global energy giant to finance the project in the form of a private company with sufficient funds and expertise.
Chevron, Exxon Mobil, Total and a few others have been mentioned as possible companies who could get involved.
However, all these companies have demanded a share in developing the gas field if they are to take the risk of financing it.
Construction of the pipeline is a costly and risky venture, and companies want to make sure that they will make enough money in order to return their investments and make a profit.
""You don't really make money from operating a pipeline,"" energy specialist John Roberts said.  ""You make money from developing a gas field and being able to export the gas.""
The problem is that Turkmenistan refuses to let any foreign company have a stake in its gas fields.
It says that these are national resources and the government should be able to control them fully.
Only China has direct access to Turkmenistan's onshore gas fields but in return China has been investing billions of dollars into Turkmenistan and fully financed the construction of the Turkmenistan-China gas pipeline.
As a result of Turkmenistan's position, all major Western energy companies are losing their interest in the Tapi project.
One indication of that was the fact that they did not have prominent representation at Turkmenistan's major international gas congress held in May.
Security issues may not be the only obstacles to shipping gas through Tapi.
It seems there is no coherent mechanism in place to prevent participating states from using the pipeline as political leverage against neighbours, particularly if there is a dispute between Pakistan and India.
Turkmenistan's approach is to sell its gas at its border and argue that it is not responsible for whatever happens afterwards, says John Roberts.
So it is not clear who will ensure that Pakistan will not cut off the gas flow into India if there is a new wave of tension between the two countries.
The Asian Development Bank, the transaction adviser of this project, gave a somewhat vague answer when approached by the BBC.
""We believe all parties will be actively working to ensure that gas flows cannot be manipulated for political advantage and they will put in place suitable mechanisms to deter adequately the temptation to do so.""
Security issues are another major challenge for this project.  More than 700km of the pipeline will cross through Afghanistan, including Helmand and Kandahar provinces that are traditionally considered to be Taliban strongholds.
The Afghan government has promised to provide troops to protect the pipeline.
However, with the end of Nato's operation, the security situation seems to be deteriorating.  Recent reports about clashes near the Turkmen-Afghan border and the Taliban gaining strength in the north makes the project even less attractive for investors.
The pipeline was expected to be operational from 2017 but has been pushed back to 2018.  Recently, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said that the pipeline would not be completed in the next five years, casting even more doubt on its future.
So a combination of security issues and financial questions means that there is a long to go before the Tapi project gets off the ground.
The way Turkmenistan deals with the financial problems in particular will have a direct impact on its other projects, including the construction of the Trans-Caspian pipeline that is projected to ship Turkmen gas to Europe.
If Turkmenistan refuses to let foreign companies have direct access to its gas fields, those other projects are - like the Tapi project - in danger of remaining pipe dreams.","For many, the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (Tapi) gas pipeline is nothing but a pipe dream.",32981469
449,"Researchers have developed an app for people to submit readings from Secchi disks - a method used since 1865.
The team hopes the data will help them understand what is happening beneath the waves.
They have been ""astonished"" by the response so far but are hoping for more readings from the southern hemisphere.
'Dramatic decline'
The Secchi disk, invented in 1865 by Angelo Secchi - the Pope's astronomer - is a circular disk that is used to measure water transparency in oceans and lakes.
The concept had long been used as a navigational tool by sailors. By lowering a dinner plate beneath the waves and measuring the depth it disappeared, it provided the crew with an indication of what ocean current they were currently sailing through.
Fr Secchi was asked by the head of the Papal Navy to measure the transparency in the Mediterranean Sea. This task gave rise to the formalised measuring system.
Ever since the first measurement was taken aboard the Papal yacht in April 1865, marine biologists have used it to measure phytoplankton abundance.
Since Secchi's first design, there have been a number of subsequent revisions. The two most common colour variations in use today are the all-white disk and the black-and-white quadrant version.
""The reason the project came about was because, in 2010, some Canadian scientists wrote a paper that suggested that the phytoplankton in the world's oceans had declined by 40% since the 1950s,"" explained project leader Richard Kirby, a research fellow at Plymouth University's Marine Institute.
""If true, this is a dramatic decline. As phytoplankton starts the food chain, they dictate the productivity at every level above,"" he observed.
""Ultimately, phytoplankton determines the amount of fish in the sea and the number of polar bears on the ice.""
Marine biologists have been using the Secchi disk method to measure the abundance of phytoplankton for 150 years.
The white disk measures 30cm (1ft) in diameter and is lowered into the water on the end of a tape measure. When it is no longer visible from the surface, the reading - known as the Secchi depth - is recorded.
""It is a very robust method and not prone to error and it is a good measure of phytoplankton abundance,"" Dr Kirby told BBC News.
""Away from estuaries and more than a kilometre from the coast, the main influence on water clarity is phytoplankton.""
He explained how he had the idea of setting up a citizen science project: ""It occurred to me sat at my desk that while there are a lot of scientists, there are not that many that are marine scientists, and fewer still that go to sea.
""And the ones that do go to sea do not go out very far. If they do go out far, they rarely go back to the same place.
""I thought that there are an awful lot of sailors out there; day sailors, cruising sailors. Many of these sailors will sail the same waters and take the same route time and time again.""
All at sea
Dr Kirby, and colleagues Drs Nicholas Outram and Nigel Barlow from the University's School of Computing and Mathematics, developed the Secchi Disk App that would store a reading while at sea before uploading it to a database once the smartphone was back within range of a mobile phone network.
""We can now collect Secchi depth measurements from all over the world's oceans and add that to the data from the 1860s to make a continuous - with a slight dip - record to see what is happening to the phytoplankton in the oceans,"" he said.
The database, managed by Dr Sam Lavender, is accessible, free-of-charge, from the project's website.
The reason for collecting measurements via the Secchi method, Dr Kirby explained, was because the Canadian team's findings proved to be quite controversial among scientists.
""Some said that they did not see any similar decline, while others said they saw an increase rather than a decline,"" he said.
Feeling the heat
The study was criticised because it combined Secchi disk measurements with data gathered using modern technology that became available to scientists in the late 20th Century.
Despite the criticism, the authors have defended their findings, saying the dramatic decline was a result of sea surface temperature.
""They said that the warming had increased stratification so fewer nutrients were reaching the oceans' surface, and so there was less phytoplankton growth,"" Dr Kirby said.
He added that in the waters around UK shores, observations showed that phytoplankton were appearing at different times of the year.
He said that changes in the seas' seasons had potential consequences for life beneath the waves.
""This is changing the coupling in the marine ecosystem. Evolutionarily, everything is synchronised - just as it is on land.
""When the timings start altering, even by just a fraction, then things no longer work through the food chain.""
To help raise awareness of the vital role phytoplankton plays in marine and terrestrial food chains, Dr Kirby has written and produced a short film called Ocean Drifters, which has been sent to every secondary school in England.
Narrated by Sir David Attenborough, the film also explains how plankton is responsible for the familiar smell of ""sea air"", and how the tiny organisms are involved in the formation of clouds.","A study is calling on the world's sailors to help map the oceans' phytoplankton, microscopic plants that form the bedrock of marine food chains.",26483166
450,"The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) requires the unanimous support of all 28 EU member nations.
Belgium's French-speaking government in the southern region of Wallonia looks likely to block it due to fears that it could lead to a flood of cheap imports.
Belgium's federal government approves of the deal, but must get confirmation from the country's three regions.
CETA's failure could throw a spanner in ongoing trade negotiations with the US and Japan, and cast doubt on the likelihood that a post-Brexit Britain could negotiate a speedy and favourable deal with Europe.
""If the EU cannot do a deal with Canada, I think it is legitimate to say: Who the heck can it do a deal with?"" Canadian International Trade Minister Chrystia Freeland said in June.
EU trade ministers will meet next week to decide on the way forward.
""We had hoped that the negotiators would have at least tried to find some improvements, some corrections for Belgium. Today that hasn't happened,"" Andre Antoine, president of the Walloon regional parliament, told reporters.
Wallonia residents fear that the deal overly protects foreign multinational companies, and will threaten the livelihood of local beef and pork producers.
Christopher Sands, who is the Director of the Center for Canadian Studies at Johns Hopkins University, says that Britain's vote to leave the EU spelled doom for CETA from the start.
The UK is Canada's largest trading partner in Europe, and without its influence, Canada has much less leverage in trade negotiations.
""Canada is in an unexpected quandary,"" Mr Sands told the BBC.
The requirement that not just all member states, but also all regional governments ratify the agreement is unprecedented, said Mr Sands, adding that the dispute process is still unclear.
The Walloon parliament will meet on Friday to officially decide its stance.
If EU trade ministers do ratify the deal, then Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will follow through on his scheduled visit to Brussels later this month where he is to sign the agreement.
Canada's parliamentary secretary for International Trade has been meeting with delegates from Wallonia to advocate for the deal, Alex Lawrence, a spokesman for the international trade minister, told BBC News.",A long-awaited trade deal between Canada and the European Union could be halted by a region of Belgium.,37603878
451,"His admission follows years of speculation about who came up with the original ideas underlying the digital cash system.
Mr Wright has provided technical proof to back up his claim using coins known to be owned by Bitcoin's creator.
Prominent members of the Bitcoin community and its core development team say they have confirmed his claims.
But many others in the Bitcoin world are asking for more proof.
Mr Wright has revealed his identity to three media organisations - the BBC, the Economist and GQ.
At the meeting with the BBC, Mr Wright digitally signed messages using cryptographic keys created during the early days of Bitcoin's development. The keys are inextricably linked to blocks of bitcoins known to have been created or ""mined"" by Satoshi Nakamoto.
""These are the blocks used to send 10 bitcoins to Hal Finney in January [2009] as the first bitcoin transaction,"" said Mr Wright during his demonstration.
Renowned cryptographer Hal Finney was one of the engineers who helped turn Mr Wright's ideas into the Bitcoin protocol, he said.
""I was the main part of it, but other people helped me,"" he said.
Soon after Mr Wright went public, Gavin Andresen, chief scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation, published a blog backing his claim.
""I believe Craig Steven Wright is the person who invented Bitcoin,"" he wrote.
Jon Matonis, an economist and one of the founding directors of the Bitcoin Foundation, said he was convinced that Mr Wright was who he claimed to be.
""During the London proof sessions, I had the opportunity to review the relevant data along three distinct lines: cryptographic, social, and technical,"" he said.
""It is my firm belief that Craig Wright satisfies all three categories.""
Mr Wright said he planned to release information that would allow others to cryptographically verify that he is Satoshi Nakamoto.
Not everyone has been convinced by Mr Wright's claims and the technical proof he put in his blog. Some cryptographers and developers who worked through the information provided said they had trouble getting verifiable information out of it.
Security expert Dan Kaminsky said the procedure was almost ""maliciously resistant"" to validation.
Many people have called on Mr Wright to go further in proving his identify.
Bitcoin is often referred to as a new kind of currency.
But it may be best to think of its units being virtual tokens rather than physical coins or notes.
However, like all currencies its value is determined by how much people are willing to exchange it for.
To process Bitcoin transactions, a procedure called ""mining"" must take place, which involves a computer solving a difficult mathematical problem with a 64-digit solution.
For each problem solved, one block of Bitcoins is processed. In addition the miner is rewarded with new Bitcoins.
This provides an incentive for people to provide computer processing power to solve the problems.
To compensate for the growing power of computer chips, the difficulty of the puzzles is adjusted to ensure a steady stream of new Bitcoins are produced each day.
There are currently about 15 million Bitcoins in existence.
To receive a Bitcoin, a user must have a Bitcoin address - a string of 27-34 letters and numbers - which acts as a kind of virtual post-box to and from which the Bitcoins are sent.
Since there is no registry of these addresses, people can use them to protect their anonymity when making a transaction.
These addresses are in turn stored in Bitcoin wallets, which are used to manage savings.
They operate like privately run bank accounts - with the proviso that if the data is lost, so are the Bitcoins owned.
By going public, Mr Wright hopes to put an end to press speculation about the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto. The New Yorker, Fast Company, Newsweek and many other media organisations have all conducted long investigations seeking Bitcoin's creator and named many different people as candidates.
In December 2015, two magazines, Wired and Gizmodo, named Mr Wright as a candidate after receiving documents believed to be stolen from him that revealed his involvement with the project.
Soon after these stories were published, authorities in Australia raided the home of Mr Wright. The Australian Taxation Office said the raid was linked to a long-running investigation into tax payments rather than Bitcoin.
Questioned about this raid, Mr Wright said he was cooperating fully with the ATO.
""We have lawyers negotiating with them over how much I have to pay,"" he said.
The stories in December have led to many more journalists and others pursuing him and people he knows, he said.
""There are lots of stories out there that have been made up and I don't like it hurting those people I care about,"" he said. ""I don't want any of them to be impacted by this.""
""I have not done this because it is what I wanted. It's not because of my choice,"" he said, adding that he had no plans to become the figurehead for bitcoins.
""I really do not want to be the public face of anything,"" he said, expressing regret that he had been forced to reveal his identity.
""I would rather not do it,"" he said. ""I want to work, I want to keep doing what I want to do. I don't want money. I don't want fame. I don't want adoration. I just want to be left alone.""
Bitcoins are now accepted as payment for a vast variety of goods and services - everything from international money transfers to ransoms for data encrypted by computer viruses. There are currently about 15.5 million bitcoins in circulation. Each one is worth about $449 (Â£306).
Satoshi Nakamoto is believed to have amassed about one million Bitcoins which would give him a net worth, if all were converted to cash, of about $450m.

He said the debt, which he blamed on the organization's previous leadership, will now be dealt with by a liquidator.
""I can tell you now that we don't owe anybody anymore,"" Chiyangwa said.
He added the process has been approved by Fifa and done with the ""blessings"" of football's world governing body.
However, Fifa said it ""has not received any communication on the outcome of Zifa's  extraordinary congress on 4 June 2016 to decide on the possible dissolution of the association"".
Zimbabwe's federation had been in financial crisis for years because of a combination of mismanagement, alleged corruption, and the serious economic woes of the southern African nation.
At one point Zifa had to sell off assets, including an artificial training field, to raise money to pay its debts.
Zimbabwe was thrown out of qualifying for the 2018 World Cup by Fifa for failing, after numerous warnings, to pay a former coach wages it owed him.
The federation's latest problems came as Zimbabwe qualified for the African Cup of Nations on Sunday for the first time in 10 years.
One of the last acts of the old Zifa was to hand bans ranging from 10 years to life to a former national team assistant coach and two former federation officials for attempting to fix games.
Former assistant coach Nation Dube Ian Gorowa and former executive committee member Edzai Kasinauyo were banned for 10 years. Henrietta Rushwaya, once the federation chief executive, received a life ban for the second time for involvement in the attempted fixing.
Rushwaya was banned for life after a previous match-fixing scandal, but that sanction was overturned.

453,"Particles called D-mesons seem to decay slightly differently from their antiparticles, LHCb physicist Matthew Charles told the HCP 2011 meeting on Monday.
The result may help explain why we see so much more matter than antimatter.
The team stresses that further analysis will be needed to shore up the result.
At the moment, they are claiming a statistical certainty of ""3.5 sigma"" - suggesting that there is less than a 0.05% chance that the result they see is down to chance.
The team has nearly double the amount of data that they have analysed so far, so time will tell whether the result reaches the ""five-sigma"" level that qualifies it for a formal discovery.
The LHCb detector was designed to examine particles containing so-called beauty quarks, watching them decay through time after high-energy collisions of other fundamental particles.
The LHCb Collaboration was looking at decays of particles called D-mesons, which contain what are known as charmed-quarks, which can in turn decay into kaons and pions.
LHCb, one of the six separate experiments at the Large Hadron Collider, is particularly suited for examining what is called ""charge-parity violation"" - slight differences in behaviour if a given particle is swapped for its antimatter counterpart (changing its charge) and turned around one of its axes (changing its parity).
Our best understanding of physics so far, called the Standard Model, suggests that the complicated cascades of decay of D-mesons into other particles should be very nearly the same - within less than 0.1% - as a similar chain of antimatter decays.
Other experiments, notably at the Fermi National Accelerator facility in the US, have not definitively found a notable difference between the two kinds of decay of D-mesons.
But the LHCb team is reporting a difference of about 0.8% - a significant difference that, if true, could herald the first ""new physics"" to be found at the LHC.
""Our result is more significant because our precision is improved - somewhat more precise than all of the previous results put together,"" Dr Charles told BBC News.
Spotting such a difference in the behaviour of matter and antimatter particles may also finally help explain why our Universe is overwhelmingly made of matter.
""Certainly this kind of effect, a new source of CP violation, could be a manifestation of the physics which drives the matter - antimatter asymmetry,"" Dr Charles explained.
However, he stressed there are ""many steps in the chain"" between confirming the collaboration's experimental result, and resolving the theory to accommodate it.
""This result is a hint of something interesting and if it bears out, it will mean that, at a minimum, our current theoretical understanding needs improving,"" Dr Charles said.
""It's exactly the sort of thing for which the LHC was originally built.""","Large Hadron Collider researchers have shown off what may be the facility's first ""new physics"" outside our current understanding of the Universe.",15734668
454,"It means the BBC could lose coverage of the Games in the UK from 2022, although Eurosport's parent company Discovery may lease back some of the rights.
The European rights are currently split up, country by country.
The deal will be effective for most of Europe from 2018, and in France and the UK from 2022.
Discovery and Eurosport confirmed they will develop a new Olympic TV Channel across Europe.
Media watchdog Ofcom lists the Olympics as a category A event, which must have live coverage made available to free-to-air channels.
In a statement, Discovery said it was committed to broadcasting a minimum of 200 hours of the Olympic Games and 100 hours of the Olympic Winter Games on free-to-air television, during the games period.
Thomas Bach, the president of the International Olympic Committee, said: ""The revenue generated from this long-term partnership will be redistributed by the IOC across the Olympic Movement to support the development of sport around the world.""
The BBC had in previous years been awarded the rights as part of a deal between the IOC and a group of public broadcasters across Europe.
If the BBC wants to broadcast the Olympics in future it will now have to negotiate with a rival broadcaster, Discovery.
The BBC said the Olympic Games remain ""a priority"" and that it has already secured the TV, radio and online rights to the next three Games in 2016, 2018 and 2020.
It will be ""seeking further discussions with Discovery about the UK free-to-air rights to the 2022 and 2024 Olympic Games in due course"".
""More than 90% of the UK population watched the BBC's coverage of London 2012 and it remains one of the most popular free-to-air, sporting events for UK viewers,"" the BBC said.
""It is not unprecedented for sports rights to be sold on a pan-territory basis, and the BBC has acquired other sports rights via sub-licensing deals with either agencies or broadcasters,"" it added.
In a conference call with the BBC, Mr Bach, said:  ""Public broadcasters have played a significant role in spreading the Games and broadcasting the Games... (but) Eurosport has contributed a lot to this in the past.
""In Great Britain, BBC has the rights to 2020. There is ample time before 2022 and 2024 to have discussions with Discovery about their cooperation. This deal at the moment is not excluding anyone, but it is showing a new broader approach to Olympic broadcasting.""
The first Olympics to be broadcast on the BBC came from London in 1948. Since then, it has broadcast the Games continuously since Rome 1960.

456,"There were 3.5 million cases of guinea worm worldwide when Jimmy Carter's organisation started tackling the disease in 1986.
Now there are just 126 cases globally - many of them in South Sudan and Mali.
Mr Carter acknowledged that Ebola had diverted some resources - but said this was ""only proper"".
Eradication of guinea worm would make it the first human disease to have been wiped out since smallpox - and the first to be eliminated without a vaccine or medicine.
The highly debilitating infection comes from a parasite and is spread by drinking contaminated water.
Mr Carter told me: ""It's hard to get our people and vehicles into South Sudan and Mali, because of the conflict in both those countries.
""But we're making good progress there, as well as in Chad and Ethiopia, where the remaining cases are.
""It's impossible to determine exactly when we'll do away with it - but I think it will be in the next two or three years at the latest.
""Once the disease begins, you can't do anything about it until the worm comes out of the human body.
""That takes about a month, because the worm is about a metre long. It's a horrible disease, a terrible affliction.""
The organisation he founded, the Carter Center, has visited all 26,300 villages - mostly in sub-Saharan Africa - which have had guinea worm, to train people in dealing with it and preventing it.
The former president added: ""Once the water is contaminated, if people don't use a proper filter cloth for every drink, the disease can come out of that pond of filthy water again.
""So we have to monitor villages even if they didn't have a case last year, because they might have a case this year.
""You have to be constantly vigilant.
""There's no doubt Ebola has taken away some effort from fighting guinea worm in Mali - but it's very proper that people have concentrated on Ebola.""
He said efforts to tackle other health conditions had been temporarily diverted to focus on Ebola.
""We've trained 144 psychiatric nurses in Liberia - because there have been terrible problems in that country with mental health.
""Their work has been diverted into helping fight Ebola, but they'll go back to their psychiatric work now.
""The crisis needed to be met and we were glad to turn those nurses loose to work on Ebola.""
Mr Carter's team is also tackling river blindness, another terrible parasitic disease which causes sight loss and skin problems.
It results in itching which is so hard to endure that some sufferers take their own lives.
The transmission of river blindness has been stopped in Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala and Mexico - but the disease is still endemic in more than 30 countries in Africa and Latin America.
Drug treatment exists and many free doses have been supplied by the manufacturer Merck, but eradication is further away than with guinea worm.
Mr Carter said: ""The policy has traditionally been to control the disease and prevent blindness by targeting the microscopic worms.
""But the adult worms would remain in the body and still need treating year after year.
""The Carter Center began an experiment in Latin America. We found that treating the disease more than once a year meant you could actually eliminate it.
""We alone will treat around 25 million people for river blindness this year.
""We've proven in Latin America, as well as Sudan and Uganda, that the disease can be completely eliminated.
""And it gives people in Africa who've suffered so long with these diseases an element of confidence, self-respect and hope for the future.""
Mr Carter, who turned 90 in October, added: ""I've been blessed with good health, and I still enjoy going out to these countries and leading the work. I'm still going strong!""
Last week, Mr Carter sent the manuscript for his 29th book to his publisher.

The charity has launched a video campaign on Facebook, encouraging viewers to raise funds and awareness by sharing the hashtag #givethemrefuge.
The launch comes as Refuge's specialist services face possible funding cuts.
One in four women in the UK experience domestic violence, and two women are killed each week by a partner or ex-partner in England and Wales, the charity said.
Refuge's video shows a girl unwrapping presents while being filmed by her sister, but the children end up abandoning their presents to run away from a violent argument between their parents.
An unnamed 22-year-old abuse victim said the fictional video was similar to her own childhood memories of living in ""daily fear and terror"" after witnessing her father ""abuse, threaten and intimidate"" her mother.
""It was only after a frantic phone call I had with my father that I knew he would fulfil his threat to 'smash her brains against the wall' and kill my mother,"" she said.
She eventually escaped to a refuge with her mother and brother, where they were supported by Refuge, she said.
""Not only did the refuge give us safety, anonymity and a place to overcome our trauma and rebuild our lives, but my brother and I had the opportunity to enjoy our childhood and also start over,"" she said.
Sandra Horley, chief executive of Refuge, said more than 3,300 women and children were supported by the charity, with children making up about two-thirds of people in the charity's accommodation.

Dr Kent Brantly was flown home for treatment on Saturday. His colleague Nancy Writebol arrived back in the city of Atlanta on Tuesday.
Since February, 887 people have died of Ebola in four West African countries.
US National Security Adviser Susan Rice said on Tuesday that the risk of Ebola transmission in the US is ""very low"".
""We have in this country the protocols to isolate and manage any patient who may present with those symptoms of the disease,"" she said.
Meanwhile, another man is being tested for Ebola at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York after travelling to West Africa.
The hospital said he was in isolation and ""was stable overnight and in good spirits"".
The World Bank is allocating $200m (Â£120m) in emergency assistance for countries battling to contain the Ebola outbreak.
It is the world's deadliest outbreak to date and has centred on Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. There have also been two cases in the Nigerian city of Lagos, where eight people are currently in quarantine.
British Airways has temporarily suspended flights to and from Liberia and Sierra Leone until 31 August 2014 because of the health crisis, the airline said in a statement. It follows a similar suspension by two regional air carriers last week.
The virus spreads by contact with infected blood and bodily fluids. The current outbreak is killing between 50% and 60% of people infected.
There is no cure or vaccine for Ebola - but patients have a better chance of survival if they receive early treatment.
Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, says clinical trials are to start in September on an Ebola vaccine that has shown promising results during tests on animals.
""By the middle to end of 2015, we'll be able to have some vaccine - at least to vaccinate health workers - who put themselves at considerable risk when they take care of these patients,"" he told the BBC's Newsday programme.
The US aid workers were treated with the ZMapp serum before their evacuation from Liberia.
According to a CNN report, quoting a doctor in Liberia, Dr Brantly's condition improved dramatically within an hour of receiving the drug.
Service in Mission (SIM), the Christian aid group that employs Ms Writebol, says she has had two doses of the drug and did not respond as well as Dr Brantly but she is showing ""improvement"".
""She is walking with assistance... strength is better... has an appetite,"" SIM spokesman Palmer Holt told the Washington Post newspaper in an email on Monday.
Ms Writebol is in a special isolation ward at Atlanta's Emory University Hospital, where Dr Brantly is being treated by infectious disease specialists.
Three companies, the US government and the Public Health Agency of Canada are behind the experimental drug.
""ZMapp was first identified as a drug candidate in January 2014 and has not yet been evaluated for safety in humans. As such, very little of the drug is currently available,"" Mapp Biopharmaceutical said in a statement.
""Mapp and its partners are co-operating with appropriate government agencies to increase production as quickly as possible.""
Ebola has initial flu-like symptoms that can lead to external haemorrhaging from areas like eyes and gums, and internal bleeding which can lead to organ failure.
In another development, the World Health Organization is to hold an emergency meeting in Geneva starting on Wednesday to discuss new measures to tackle the Ebola outbreak.
The meeting will decide whether to declare a global health emergency which could involve imposing travel restrictions on affected countries.

The group behind the adverts condemned the fire, calling it ""a criminal act"".
Jens Moeller Jensen, a spokesman for Copenhagen's police force, told the Associated Press: ""There could be a political motive. We consider this one theory. But we cannot link it to anything for now.""
The advertisements were paid for by the Danish-Palestinian Friendship Association. It says it works ""to influence the Danish public and the Danish authorities to do more for the Palestinians' right to self-determination.""

Hitachi promised a ""comfortable ride"" even at high speeds in the new lift.
The lifts would prevent ear blockages, Hitachi said, by artificially altering air pressure in the car.
Dr Gina Barney, an expert in lift technology, said protecting passengers from discomfort was a big challenge for high-speed lifts.
""When you're travelling that distance, you're going to get pressures on your ears changing,"" she told the BBC.
""That's probably the most significant problem with high-speed travel in buildings - people suffer some pain.""

Who will win it this time? We asked 30 BBC TV and radio pundits, presenters and commentators for their one-two-three-four prediction ahead of the new campaign, and for an explanation of their selection.
Only five teams feature in the predictions and, with 22 votes, Chelsea are the overwhelming favourites to retain their title. Four votes went to Arsenal and two apiece to Manchester United and Manchester City.
Most people made their predictions on the basis of how each squad shapes up now, ahead of the opening weekend, but Chris Waddle, Pat Nevin and Alistair Mann made their choices because they think City and United will make some significant signings before the transfer window closes on 1 September.
19 out of 29 BBC experts correctly backed them to win the title last year. This season, 22 out of 30 have picked them to retain it, and only one person out of 30 thinks they will finish outside the top two.

Alan Shearer: The title race will be a lot tighter and I am expecting the top four to be bunched together for most of the season.
But Chelsea are still the team to beat because of their experience and I also think they will be better than they were last year when Diego Costa was injured a lot last season and Cesc Fabregas did not play his best football from February onwards.
It also would not surprise me if they sign another big hitter before the transfer window shuts.
Ruud Gullit: I think they will buy another striker. We saw against Arsenal in the Community Shield that they might have a problem up front when Costa is unavailable. Jose Mourinho hopes Radamel Falcao is the answer but I did not see that at Wembley. I hope Falcao succeeds too, but I think Chelsea still need another powerful striker as back-up to Costa.

BBC Radio 5 live football correspondent John Murray: Chelsea still have the best squad and certainly have the best defence.
Pat Nevin: The manager makes a big difference too, of course. I think Mourinho will get more out of a number of his players this season, with Oscar being one of them.
Graeme Le Saux: You know Mourinho's tactics will be spot on, even if the personnel changes. Nobody is a passenger in this Chelsea team, no matter who comes in, and reliability is one of the requirement of all his players. That consistency underpins everything they do, and on top of that they have got some amazingly creative players.
Chris Sutton: Mourinho has to address Chelsea's lack of creativity in the second half of last season but the fact remains he is an outstanding manager who always finds a way to win games.
BBC Radio 5 live's senior football reporter Ian Dennis: Just as in 2005 and 2006 I'm tipping Mourinho to claim back-to-back titles with Chelsea. I think he will get the best out of Falcao but I expect Arsenal to push them close.

Ian Wright: Yes. I am optimistic about Arsenal's title chances every season, but this season I am more confident than usual - and not just because I am a fan and desperately want it to happen.
I am gambling a lot on their start, because they began badly last year and won only two of their first eight games, but they showed at the end of last season they can put a run together and now they know what it takes to win the title. I think the team will be tighter at the back and, with the attacking ability Arsenal have, I think they can do it.
Gabby Logan: Yes. I had a big interview with Arsene Wenger before last season's FA Cup final and I am a believer. I just feel a change coming!
Jermaine Jenas: No - but I would say Arsenal are the most balanced team and best equipped to push Chelsea all the way. Signing Petr Cech is really going to shore up their defence and could bring them an extra 5-10 points. They are the one team Mourinho will really fear this year and, if they can stay close to them throughout the season, Chelsea might react differently.
Alan Shearer: No. They will be closer, but I still think they need a top-class centre-forward to go that step further and win the title.
Two out of 29 BBC experts backed United to win the title last season - but nobody else thought they would make the top two and 14 people thought they would miss out on the top four. This time, 16 people think they will finish at least third and no-one thinks they will finish lower than fourth.
Dion Dublin: Yes. I've backed them to win it because it has been far too long, but also because the pressure is now on Louis van Gaal to win things and I think Wayne Rooney will be the man to deliver for him - United as a club thrive off pressure.
Ruud Gullit: No. I am surprised they have not strengthened their defence more already - I don't get it. Louis van Gaal did the same last year, when he brought in a lot of forward players. If building a squad is like building a house, he started with the roof instead of the foundations and it did not go well. This year, he has done the same again. It surprises me that he has confidence in his existing players at the back.
Kevin Kilbane: No. In pre-season Van Gaal has been playing Daley Blind at centre-half. That is all well and good in friendlies when United have lots of possession because he is excellent on the ball but, in games against the top teams, I think they could get caught out for pace on the counter-attack. They look vulnerable.
Match of the Day commentator Jonathan Pearce: No. They lack a dominant centre-back and will rely too much on Rooney for goals. Selling Robin Van Persie was a mistake. This team is still at the building stage. Unless Van Gaal provides more entertaining football, the supporters - who have been very lenient so far - will turn on him.
Jacqui Oatley: I'm fascinated to see how United start the season now that Van Gaal has had time to bed in. Surely he won't go much longer without buying a leader in defence?
Media playback is not supported on this device
Pat Nevin: Making a decision on this now before the end of the transfer window is silly because I suspect United will be a lot stronger and plug a couple of gaps. If they get an extra centre-half in and maybe a centre-forward, then it would make a big difference and I would put them up in second place. If they don't, I think they are still third or fourth.
Mark Lawrenson: I think United might have a 'blow you out of the water' transfer left in them this summer, I really do. I just have a feeling they might be able to prise Gareth Bale or Cristiano Ronaldo away from Real Madrid, and that would make a massive difference to the title race.
Last season, eight out of 29 BBC experts thought City would win the title, and only five thought they would finish outside the top two - they ended up as runners-up. This year, two people are backing them to be champions and 22 out of 30 think they will finish third at best.
Pat Nevin: Vincent Kompany and Yaya Toure are massively important to the City team and I just don't know if they are going to be as good as they were again. If they aren't, I don't think City have a good enough squad to win the league.
Trevor Sinclair: There are question marks over the manager Manuel Pellegrini too. There were a couple of big games against Arsenal and United in the second half of last season where City were outmanoeuvred tactically and, against Barcelona in the Champions League, they were really out of their depth.
Match of the Day commentator Steve Wilson: For me, City are in a kind of limbo at the moment. I didn't expect to see Pellegrini at the club this season and would expect him to be out of the door about a nano-second after Pep Guardiola says he's willing to move to Manchester. But when, or if, that happens is anyone's guess.
Match of the Day commentator Guy Mowbray: City are the hardest call of all. They could just as easily be first - and might be. The persistent Guardiola rumours might play a part.
Match of the Day commentator Alistair Mann: I really feel that Manchester City are going to complete a couple more major transfer coups which will tip the title race in their favour.
Chris Waddle: City will have licked their wounds from last season and will come back stronger. Raheem Sterling is a big addition and I am sure there are one or two more on the way to make them stronger.
Last season, 15 out of 29 BBC experts wrongly thought Liverpool would make the top four. This time around, 29 out of 30 think they will miss out.
Mark Lawrenson: It looks like they have a better balance to their squad than last season and they are definitely better off with their options with their attacking players if Daniel Sturridge has more injuries.
Didi Hamann: There are a lot of unknowns, but firstly the players they brought in last year have obviously got to to do better. I like the signings they have made this year and I think they have got a chance but, as of now, you have got to say that the other four teams are ahead of them.

John Hartson: They will certainly miss Steven Gerrard, although Jordan Henderson will do a good job of skippering the side. Christian Benteke is a good signing who has got everything you need as a striker but the question for me is can Liverpool give him the service he needs in the box because they will have to change the way they play?
Former Liverpool Ladies and Everton Ladies goalkeeper Rachel Brown-Finnis: Liverpool are rebuilding and that is going to take another couple of years because it is harder to attract the top players when you do not have Champions League football.
Match of the Day commentator Conor McNamara: They won't make it, but that is not to say they won't show a big improvement on last season. Brendan Rodgers' recruitment this summer has already been streets ahead of the players he brought in 12 months ago - but the problem for Liverpool is that all of the last season's top four have strengthened as well.
Last year, Leicester survived but Burnley and QPR made a quick return to the Championship. This time Watford, Norwich and Bournemouth are the teams looking to beat the odds.

Jermaine Jenas: I really enjoyed watching Bournemouth last year and their style of play probably suits the Premier League best out of the three promoted teams. But that pretty tippy-tappy football they play won't pay-off if they don't put their chances away. That is something you can get away with in the Championship because you know other chances are going to come. In the Premier League it is the total opposite, so they will need to be more clinical.
Pat Nevin: I just have a feeling for Norwich. That has a lot to do with their manager Alex Neil. who I have watched a lot in his short but hugely illustrious career as a manager at Hamilton and then at Carrow Road. He immediately gets the best out of players.

Match of the Day commentator Steve Bower: I was at Wembley to witness Norwich winning the Championship play-off final in a very professional manner and I think with their young, hungry manager and a squad of players that have had Premier League experience before they have the best chance of staying up.
Chris Sutton: I live in the Norwich area and people are saying 'we will be alright with three or four quality signings' but it is hard for Norwich to attract them because all the top players want to go to the top clubs. Alex Neil is trying to get a striker in but that has not worked out, and it will be interesting how they get on.
MOTD2 host and BBC Radio 5 live presenter Mark Chapman: This will probably make me look an idiot but, hey, that's the whole point of predictions isn't it? I am going to say that all three will stay up. Bournemouth's football at times last season was excellent and Eddie Howe won't change his philosophy in the Premier League. It could cause a lot of teams problems.
Watford, thanks to the Pozzo family, are part of one of the best, if not THE best scouting system in the world and there will be some gems in that squad by the end of the window. And Norwich are a club with Premier League set-up. If they can find a striker capable of regularly scoring in the top flight they should be fine too.","The Premier League starts again on Saturday, with Chelsea defending the title they won by eight points last season.",33764700
473,"DJI said the update to the small drone's core software fixes some flight control issues suffered by the gadget.
The drone maker said it had warned owners about the deadline so they could avoid having their craft grounded.
But the mandatory update has caused some owners to question the control DJI retains over their devices.
In a statement, DJI said the update would improve how the Spark manages power. It also helps it work with smart spectacles that give owners an immersive view of what the drone films.
It added: ""If the firmware of either the aircraft or the battery is not updated by September 1, Spark will not be able to take off.""
The update is now available via the Go 4 management app used to configure and fly the craft as well as DJI's Assistant 2 desktop software.
A spokesman said it issued the warning so it could be sure Spark owners took the chance to update their drone before the deadline so craft are not grounded.
Gary Mortimer, writing on drone news site SUAS News, said DJI's demand that people apply the software had caused ""consternation"".
He said performance fixes bestowed by the software  were welcome but DJI's ability to throw a kill switch to stop the device working was more ""questionable"".
Earlier this month, the US Army banned serving soldiers from using DJI drones saying their use posed  ""operational risks"". In response, DJI drones were given a privacy mode that restricted who saw the video they shot.","DJI Spark drones will not fly after 1 September unless owners apply a mandatory software update, the device's maker has warned.",41011659

Andy Murray suffered a nasty fall during the third set and is scheduled to play French number one Gilles Simon at 12:30 BST on Sunday, although Wimbledon semi-finalist Richard Gasquet could be drafted in.
""It was my hip,"" said the 28-year-old. ""Everyone's fallen a few times on the court but thankfully it was OK.
""It's sore but we've got one more match tomorrow hopefully, and then I can rest for a few days.""
His brother Jamie, 29, added: ""It was brilliant, the crowd were amazing, twice as loud as yesterday and we absolutely loved it.
""Thanks to the supporters who cheered from start to finish and hopefully we're in a good position to win the tie now.""
Captain Leon Smith's decision to play both Murray brothers and leave out the big-serving Dom Inglot was vindicated, eventually.
Jamie Murray, fresh from reaching the men's doubles final at Wimbledon last week, was superb throughout, while his younger brother's form improved as the match went on.

A home win looked far from certain after France took the opening set thanks to a single break of serve, but a successful Hawk-Eye challenge from Andy Murray helped the Britons level at one set all.
The third was a desperately close contest of strong serving that was heading for a tie-break when Andy Murray slipped badly while chasing down a smash.
It appeared British hopes might have vanished as he had lengthy treatment, but once back on court the brothers played a brilliant tie-break.
An Andy Murray volley brought up set point on the Tsonga serve, and the two-time Grand Slam champion played a terrific return that the Frenchman could not control.
The brothers leapt in the air in celebration and, roared on by the home fans in the crowd of 6,900, they powered into a 5-0 lead in the fourth set before Jamie Murray sealed victory with a smash.
""I'm immensely proud of the brothers,"" said Smith. ""I thought the team energy was fantastic and the crowd was just phenomenal again.""
Murray, the world number three, has lost just two of his 23 Davis Cup singles matches and never on grass.
He has a 5-3 record against Gasquet and a 12-2 record against Simon, although the Frenchman did win their last match indoors in Rotterdam in February.
""It's a tough day tomorrow,"" said Smith. ""No-one should presume it's an easy match for Andy and he's going to need to be at his best again to win that one.""
Murray said: ""They obviously have options and we'll find out an hour beforehand [who plays], there's no point worrying about it. I've played well against both of them before on the grass, so that's a positive.""
Should Murray fail to win his second singles match, the tie would come down to a fifth and final rubber between James Ward and either Gasquet, Tsonga or Mahut.
Britain won their ninth and most recent Davis Cup back in 1936 under the inspirational leadership of Fred Perry, and last made the final in 1978.
The prize on offer on Sunday is a semi-final against Kazakhstan or Australia, with the Kazakhs leading 2-1 heading into the final day in Darwin.
On the other side of the draw, Belgium have seen off a Canada side without Milos Raonic and Vasek Pospisil, while Argentina beat a Serbia side missing Novak Djokovic.
Mahut did not speak, Tsonga managed a weak smile of resignation and team captain Arnaud Clement just about retained his game face.
The mood in the French camp was clear when they faced the media after the defeat.
""We will talk about tomorrow a little bit later,"" was Clement's response when asked whether the official singles line-up of Simon and Tsonga will remain unchanged.

The UN Development Programme (UNDP) appointed the tennis star as a goodwill ambassador in February 2007, but suspended her in March after her doping admission.
""The UNDP is glad to learn that Maria Sharapova can return to the sport she loves sooner than expected and we will lift the suspension of her role as our goodwill ambassador once the reduced ban expires in April 2017,"" the UN statement says.

After her admission, Sharapova's sponsors were divided in their response. Sports firm Nike, racket manufacturer Head and bottled water company Evian all said they would stand by her.
But Swiss watchmaker Tag Heuer cut ties with her in March while Porsche also expressed concern about continuing its links.

He had been dismissed for reacting angrily to a 93rd-minute penalty given to Burnley, who trailed 1-0.
Wenger, who later apologised, says he will request a personal FA hearing.
""I've said what I have publicly and the rest will be more discreet,"" he said. ""I don't know if I will be punished and how I will be punished.
""The only thing I can say is that when I was sent off I was surprised and then I was in the tunnel which is where I thought I could be.""
After being sent to the stands by referee Jon Moss, Wenger moved away from the pitch but stood at the tunnel entrance and refused to move as he tried to watch the remaining few minutes of Sunday's match.
As Taylor encouraged him to move away, Wenger was seen to push back against him.
When asked if he would accept the charge, Wenger said: ""Yes. I am big enough to stand up for what I do.
""When I don't behave like I think I should behave, I am big enough to say I am not right. I'm a passionate guy and I believe that I am completely committed in my job and want to win football games.""

Local politicians have warned that the new leader must come from outside the ""contaminated"" administration.
Councillor Daniel Moylan said the ruling Conservative group has to ""show a complete break with the past"".
Mr Moyland, the Conservative former deputy leader of Kensington and Chelsea Council, said ""any idea of a continuity candidate would be a very bad idea"".
""We have to be able to go to the people of North Kensington and to the victims of the fire with a real sense of acknowledging how badly they have been let down, a real sense of shame if you like,"" he told BBC London Radio.
Kensington and Chelsea Conservatives will hold a regular group meeting on Monday evening.
It is expected during this meeting they will vote on replacements for Mr Paget-Brown and former deputy council leader Rock Feilding-Mellen, who also resigned.
The chosen candidates must then gain approval by a vote in full council, a formality given the Conservative group control 40 out of 50 seats on Kensington and Chelsea Council.

The 24-year-old collects £370,000 in prize money, while her ranking is set to jump from 47 to inside the top 30.
Kerber, 28, goes on to face world number one Serena Williams, who took just 64 minutes to thrash Polish fourth seed Agnieszka Radwanska 6-0 6-4.
The American, 34, is the defending champion and is chasing a seventh Australian Open and 22nd Grand Slam title.
The Briton made a nervous start and could not stem a flow of errors that kept the pressure off Kerber.
Konta ended the match with 36 unforced errors to the German's 11, having dropped serve five times over an hour and 22 minutes.
She looked every bit the debutante at this level as she slipped 3-0 down, with Kerber - twice a Grand Slam semi-finalist - hardly required to do anything but keep the ball in play in the early stages.
There was real hope for Konta when she found some rhythm and clawed her way back to lead 5-4 in the first set, but Kerber broke again at 5-5 and would lose just two more games.
Konta was upbeat after her loss, insisting: ""I don't think I missed an opportunity.""
She felt Kerber simply played better, adding there were a lot of positives to take from her straight-set defeat.
""I'm really hungry to keep improving and keep enjoying what I'm doing,"" she said. ""So that's where I'm at.
""I just will go back, keep working hard, keep improving the things that I want to improve and keep enjoying what I'm doing.""

Rusedski, who reached the US Open final in 1997, wrote: ""Great run for @JoKonta91 getting to the semifinals of a GS for the first time. Now into the top 30 in the world. She will only get better.""
BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller:
Johanna Konta says she has learnt to 'feel comfortable being uncomfortable' during her run to the semi-final.
The experience of winning five Grand Slam matches in a row and working through some stressful periods will stand her in great stead.
She will be 28 in the world when the rankings are updated on Monday and has very few points to defend until the grass-court season begins in June, so she has an excellent chance of being seeded for both the French Open and Wimbledon.
She has also earned the right to play in any tournament she chooses to, anywhere in the world.
It has been a phenomenal performance by a player, who before her run to the fourth round of the US Open last September, had only ever won one match in a Grand Slam main draw.
Radwanska was on a 13-match winning run, but she had lost all eight previous meetings with Williams and was again overwhelmed.
Williams was utterly dominant in the first set, her power advantage most obvious as she demolished the 5ft 8in Pole's serve, winning 12 of 16 return points as she took it in 20 minutes.
The American's form fell away in the second set, allowing Radwanska to recover from 3-1 down with four straight games that roused a crowd sympathetic to the Pole's plight.
But Radwanska missed a forehand to drop serve at 4-4 and Williams, despite racking up 13 errors to four in the first set, found three aces in a row on her way to serving out the match.
""I'm really excited to be in another final, it kind of blows my mind right now,"" said Williams.
Radwanska said it would difficult for anyone to stop Williams.
""If she's playing her best tennis, it's a big difference,"" she said. ""I don't think anyone can really play on that level.""
But Kerber responded: ""I'm really looking forward to playing Serena in the final. I have nothing to lose and will give it everything.""",Johanna Konta's superb Australian Open run came to an end with defeat by German seventh seed Angelique Kerber in the semi-finals.,35426160
480,"Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had questioned whether it would be practically possible to implement the ceasefire.
Russian air strikes and support from Iran have helped President Assad win key battles. Internationally, the threat from so-called Islamic State and the growing role of jihadi groups within the Syrian opposition have caused those countries which had wanted him gone to consider whether that remains a viable policy.
Three experts spoke to the BBC World Service Inquiry programme before the Syrian government agreed to the terms of the latest deal, about whether President Assad has effectively won the war.
Jennifer Cafarella is the Syria analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, a US military think tank.
""President Assad certainly has momentum on the battlefield. The armed opposition is mobilising significantly in order to prevent him, however, it does remain likely that Assad will be able to encircle Aleppo, after which we're expecting to see a siege and starve campaign.
""The recapture of Aleppo City could actually be sufficient to encourage many Syrian opposition fighters to stop fighting, and to abandon the war against Assad.
""His strategy to date has been to recapture key strategic terrain as well as to collapse opposition pockets that pose a threat to the core regime-held terrain. He's not trying to recapture all of the rural terrain that the opposition holds. Rather, he's trying to make sure that his gains are durable, and that they shore up his position militarily in places like Aleppo City, Homs, and Damascus.
""The core deficit that the opposition has is air power. Assad's ability to use Russian air strikes, as well as to deploy barrel bombs is not something that the opposition can make up for without receiving shoulder-to-air missile systems that they could use to shoot down aircraft.
""I think it's likely that without Iran's backing, Assad would have lost the war much earlier on, and so the continued deployment of Iranian ground troops is really keeping the regime alive and sustaining its battlefield momentum.
""For the first time we've started to see calls for the mobilisation of foreign fighters to come and fight on the opposition's behalf inside Syria. It's a very dangerous indicator of the state of the Syrian opposition. They are that desperate.
""Al-Qaeda's suicide bombers are an incredibly powerful military tool. Al-Qaeda uses them as a mechanism to penetrate a military base or a checkpoint: a suicide bomber can get up close and cause damage to the structure which the opposition would not otherwise be able to target.
""That tactic has been incredibly effective on behalf of the opposition, and is one of the reasons why the opposition will continue to rely on al-Qaeda as this war continues.
""Assad certainly is in a very strong position, and I think in the long-term, he's going to benefit from the radicalisation from the opposition.
""If Assad can get the situation in Syria to a point where we have to choose between the defence of our own homeland and our desire for Assad to go in Syria, I think it is possible that he could actually come out on top.""
Rami Khouri is an analyst at the Issam Fares Institute at the American University in Beirut.
""President Assad really relies on very, very few people to help him stay in power. That to me is a sign of weakness, not strength.
""There was a moment when Syria had very good relations with Turkey but then the Turks turned against him completely. There was a moment when the Saudis had very close relationships with the Syrians, but those have all gone down the drain now.
""It matters because what you see now is the Saudis and the Turks and others saying they're going to send their F16 jets and their special commando ground forces to northern Syria to bolster the rebels who are trying to get rid of Assad.
""There are dangerous signs of a mini-world war going on in northern Syria. It's an extraordinary situation, with so many different parties - local, government, regional powers, foreign powers - actively shooting bullets and missiles and rockets at each other, and it's something that's totally unprecedented.
""Each one of them thinks that this is an existential battle. If they lose, they are wiped out from the face of history. That's why they're willing to do this.
""The Russian/Iranian/Hezbollah group are doing what they're doing because they see losing control of Syria for Assad would be a huge strategic blow to their interests.  The Iranians and Hezbollah in particular need Syria as a link between them. The Russians see the serious situation as a means of regaining their role and international credibility in the region.
""I don't think Assad has the possibility of remaining president for a long time. The best he can do is get to a position of a ceasefire, and then a transition which he might be involved with in the first year or two, but eventually retire.
""If he's lucky, [he'll] get a deal like the Yemeni President, Ali Abdullah Saleh, which is to retire from the presidency through a political deal, and not to be sent to the International Criminal Court.  I think that's really the best that he can hope for.""
Syrian-born Hassan Hassan is an analyst at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy in Washington DC.
""When the Russians came to Syria, that gave [the regime] some security that they could actually stay, and the country is heading towards something more positive. So that gave Assad some confidence as in they supported his project. They supported his survival.
""And when Isis started to advance towards Salamiyah, people started to say 'maybe our future is tied to the regime, and we better be under the protection of the regime'. So that city was secured by the regime, and no longer has contact with the opposition. Salamiyah became a stronghold for the regime.
""[The question of whether someone in his inner circle could betray him] is the question that has been circulating in Western capitals. But I think there are practical reasons why that's not possible.
""A regime supporter explained this to me in a good way. If Bashar al-Assad wants to pick up his phone and call someone and say 'release that prisoner', he will find people who would listen to him and obey him. There's a line of command there that works.  If someone else does that, there's a big possibility that's not going to happen.
""Bashar al-Assad can get things done.  And that's what drives people to stick with him - people who are part of his loyalist base or in Tehran or Moscow.  They think that no-one else can replace him.  Not because he's some sort of genius, but because psychologically, he represents the old order.
""He has won in a sense that his strategic goal of staying in power has been achieved to a large degree, unless things change. The war is not over.""

The Reds are managerless, without a chief executive and just five points above the Championship relegation zone.
""I will let actions talk better than words,"" he told BBC Nottingham Sport.
""At the moment I am not going to sell the club. I would like to focus on the club, and I would like to build a structure and put the right people in the club.
""People will think that I am lying or just saying things that will not happen. I can say many things, but at the moment we are putting this in the right way to build the structure.""
Many supporters have become increasingly angry and disillusioned with the Al Hasawi reign, which has seen the club fail to pay bills on time, be placed under transfer embargo and part company with seven permanent managers.
Last week's 1-0 home win over Bristol City was their first win in eight matches, but was played against a backdrop of unrest as fans protested against the Forest owner.
""I [have] spent over £122m for Nottingham Forest, from the time I bought the club to now,"" Al Hasawi added.
""Every single month I put between £2.5-£2.8m of my money into the club.
""People ask where is the money for Oliver Burke and Henri Lansbury. People think that I put the money in my pocket. All of it is in the club.
""I am not a thief. I build everything from before. I bought Nottingham Forest and I invest lots of money.""
Academy director Gary Brazil is in interim charge of the Reds following the sacking of Philippe Montanier on 14 January.
Al Hasawi, who first looked to sell the club to Greek businessman Evangelos Marinakis in the summer, said he is talking to potential new managers and said the deal with the US consortium led by John Jay Moores is now ""finished"".
He said he was now determined to get things right.
""I spoke to many people who love the club and know me very well,"" he said. ""We are trying hard to put the structure for the club again.

The airport said the Boeing 737 was operated by Lithuanian firm Aurela Airlines.
Monarch said it was the same 737 which left 150 people stranded in Tenerife last month when a door broke. It said it had suspended the use of Aurela.
None of the 135 passengers involved in Friday's incident were injured.
Monarch said the plane was being taxied to the terminal in Birmingham when ""one set of wheels left the taxi way bringing the aircraft to a stop"".
Passengers said there had first appeared to be problems with the aircraft's brakes as it was being taxied in Nice, and described it as a ""very old plane"".
All flights to and from the airport were immediately suspended after the incident. The runway reopened at about 15:10 BST.
The airport warned some departures were still delayed.
Tim Witcherley, from Warwickshire, who had been on the flight, said there had first been a problem with the aircraft when it took off in Nice.
He said: ""When we were being taxied on the runway, the plane turned and there was a juddering noise, as if the brakes had locked up, like you get on a car.
""Then it took off and we had an uneventful journey until we got back to Birmingham. Again, it was when we turned right that the same juddering started, the plane tilted and we ended up on the grass.

Last month, about 150 passengers were left stranded in Tenerife for two days after the same Aurela Airlines plane, again chartered by Monarch, had technical problems.
The customers were asked to get off the plane, which was due to fly back to Birmingham Airport, after problems with a faulty door hatch.
BBC transport correspondent Richard Westcott said it was ""very common"" for companies like Monarch to hire in planes from other airlines during busy periods.
Monarch said it was working with the airport to investigate what happened in Friday's incident.
It said that as a ""standard precaution"", emergency services were called to the aircraft.
Monarch apologised to all the passengers and said it was ""offering them all possible assistance"".
Eyewitnesses said no emergency chutes were deployed and luggage was soon being taken off the aircraft.
East Midlands Airport said seven flights bound for Birmingham Airport had been diverted there.
Airport chief executive Paul Kehoe said the aircraft had now been towed away to a siding and was no longer blocking the runway or any taxiways.
He said he did not believe there was much damage to the aircraft but that engineers and the Air Accident Investigation Branch would be examining it.
West Midlands Ambulance Service said it had attended the scene and all passengers had ""safely disembarked from the aircraft"".

It is the second time this year Mr Bloch has been refused a taxi because of his dog but this time his girlfriend shared a video of it on social media.
ADT Taxis admitted its driver broke the law and he has since been sacked.
Commenting on the case, Leicester City Council said religion was ""not a sensible excuse"" and drivers are told about the law on their licence and during exams.
""It's extremely frustrating,"" said Mr Bloch, a student at De Montfort University in Leicester. ""But, it's a very common thing and happens a lot.""
Mr Bloch has deteriorating eyesight due to glaucoma and in April was refused a ride by an Uber driver who also cited religious reasons.
""I have no hatred towards the driver and his religion, and I would respect that if the law wasn't there, but the law is there to help people be more integrated into the community,"" he said.
Under the Disability Discrimination Act, it is illegal for a private hire vehicle to refuse to take a disabled person because they have an assistance dog, nor can they charge more.
Anyone found guilty of an offence under the act is liable to a fine.
Assistance dogs are defined as dogs trained to guide someone who is blind, deaf, epileptic or suffers a condition which affects mobility.
Drivers can apply to a licensing authority for exemption from carrying assistance dogs, but only on medical grounds.

Owens, 28, who was ruled out of the start of the tournament by a neck injury, has made a successful return for his region.
Francis, 22, is one of the heaviest forwards in the professional game at 6ft 1in and 21st.
Gatland names his team to face Ireland on Tuesday.
Owens is challenging incumbent Scott Baldwin, of Ospreys, and long-time rival Richard Hibbard, of Gloucester, for the Wales number two jersey.
Francis would have to leapfrog Scarlets' Samson Lee, Osprey Aaron Jarvis and Cardiff Blues' Scott Andrews in Wales' pecking order to cap a remarkable rise from virtual unknown to Test player.
Wales defence coach Shaun Edwards says Exeter's set-piece play helped bring Francis to their attention.
""He's a big kid and the Exeter scrum has been excellent recently,"" he said.
""His scrummaging is absolutely outstanding but he's also a skilful player as well.
""He's big, he's young and he's coming from a great environment.
""Exeter is a place where they pride themselves on hard work and we would like to think we're a similar sort of environment.""

However, the 60mph stretch near Conisbrough is likely to be the first section to be targeted, following the fatal crash there on 15 November.
Blake Cairns, Megan Storey and Jordanna Goodwin, all 16, and Bartosz Bortniczak and Arpar Kore, both 18, were killed.
Ms Jones said: ""We were all shocked by the tragic accident in Conisbrough last month and it is understandable that people have concerns about preventing future collisions on this section of the A630.

487,"The order requires Kylle Godfrey, 30, of Neasden, north west London, to tell police of any relationship lasting more than 14 days for the next seven years.
He is serving a three-year sentence for attacking two ex-partners and intimidating a witness while on bail.
The order is believed to be the first of its kind in England and Wales.
As part of the order, police are able to inform any of Godfrey's future partners of his previous violence towards women, under the Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme.
Since the introduction of ASBOs - anti-social behaviour orders - in 1998 the use of court orders to stop disruptive, harmful and violent behaviour has been common practice in England and Wales.
But it's highly unusual for the terms of an order to contain a requirement that offenders tell police about people they're having a relationship with - not least because it may be hard to enforce.
There is a precedent however: the case of John O'Neill, from York, who is subject to a Sexual Risk Order requiring him to tell police if he's starting a sexual relationship with a new partner.
Godfrey was jailed on 14 February after admitting to two counts of actual bodily harm, perverting the course of justice and witness intimidation.
A court heard how over several days in October last year, he attacked his ex-partner, banging her head on the floor and grabbing her around the throat.
Following his arrest, Godfrey continued to intimidate the woman and, while on bail, assaulted another woman he had started a new relationship with.
Domestic abuse charity Women's Aid described the order as a ""more robust safeguarding against domestic abuse"".
Its chief executive, Polly Neate, said it ""demonstrates an understanding that a perpetrator of domestic abuse is likely to be abusive to many partners"".
Jane Topping, of the Met Police's Hackney Community Safety Unit said: ""The order gives us a new way of protecting victims of domestic abuse and preventing other women from suffering at the hands of people like Godfrey.
""The victim in Godfrey's case was subjected to a horrendous ordeal by him following a sustained campaign of domestic violence,"" she added.

The pair did battle once more in this two-mile Grade One and God's Own beat Vautour by two lengths.
Simonsig ran a fantastic race to finish in third.
Vautour was unsurprisingly a warm order to get back on the winning trail as the 4-9 favourite.
With Special Tiara adopting his customary front-running role, Vautour and God's Own sat in his slipstream.
They were just ahead of the talented but fragile Simonsig, on his first start since November and his first outing over fences in over three years.
The leading quartet pulled clear from the home turn and there was little to choose between all four jumping the second-last fence.
God's Own and Simonsig looked set to fight it out jumping the final obstacle and it was Paddy Brennan's mount who found most to win, while Vautour stayed on to grab the runner-up spot.
""For the first mile I had no control and I just let him go, but to be fair he came back then and I filled him up. He was awesome,"" said Brennan.

490,"Matthew Hamlen had initially been cleared of the crime in 2012 but was found guilty after fresh DNA evidence came to light.
Georgina Edmonds' son found her battered body in her cottage by the banks of the River Itchen, in Hampshire, in 2008.
The 77-year-old widow, who lived alone, had been stabbed several times with a knife and tortured for her bank card Pin code before being battered with a marble rolling pin.
Following a two-year manhunt, during which almost 2,000 people were DNA tested, Hamlen was eventually charged with murder. The DNA profile was incomplete, however, and he was acquitted at Winchester Crown Court in 2012.
With no other suspects, the case was about to be effectively shelved in 2013 when Det Insp Martin Chudley, of Hampshire Constabulary, led a final review of the evidence.
""I always felt it was impossible that he left nothing behind,"" he said.
""It was a long, prolonged attack, he was there for quite some considerable time - I just couldn't conceive there wasn't a part of him there somewhere.""
Forensic samples taken from Mrs Edmonds' trousers and the rolling pin had been thought to be the most likely to yield the killer's DNA as those were items which had clearly been touched.
Hamlen's DNA had been found on the rolling pin but had been mixed with that of Mrs Edmonds. This meant a full profile may have been there but was masked by their shared characteristics.
After the acquittal, Det Insp Chudley asked scientists to re-examine samples taken from the original murder scene.
He was told it was ""unlikely to work"", but the team decided to examine some of the fibres from the back left sleeve of Ms Edmond's blouse. It proved crucial and in February 2014, a full profile of Hamlen's DNA was identified.
The Court of Appeal subsequently quashed the original not guilty verdict, paving the way for Hamlen, 36, to be put on trial for murder for a second time.
This time the DNA evidence was strong enough, along with mobile phone evidence, for the prosecution to place him at the murder scene.
His mobile phone had been used nearby, close to the time of the murder, and again near to where Mrs Edmonds' mobile had been switched on and then discarded.
Forensic scientist Geraldine Davidson told jurors the material found on the blouse was 26 million times more likely to have come from Hamlen than someone else.
The prosecution alleged he had targeted her for her money. Hamlen had a history of domestic violence and cocaine use, was suspected of dealing drugs and was thought to be considerably in debt.
However, he flatly denied any involvement in the killing.
""I know I didn't do this, I could not do something like this,"" he told the court. ""As far as the DNA goes, I'm not an expert. All I can tell you is, it didn't get there at the time, if it is mine.""
For Mrs Edmonds' family, who were left without the closure of a conviction in 2012, the guilty verdict marks the end of what her daughter Doddie described as a ""long road"".
""I try not to dwell on the details of the actual murder - she was hurt so badly and how terrified she must have been. I always thought of her as safe in her little cottage by the river.
""She was the heart of the family - she brought us all together, she was the warmth of the family.
""I think it will bring some kind of closure, some kind of justice which she deserves. But it will never bring my mother back.""","A man who broke into a pensioner's home, tortured her for her PIN number and battered her to death with a rolling pin has been convicted of her murder.",35598133

492,"Llanelli MP Nia Griffith - the shadow defence secretary - said Labour had to be ready ""at any moment"" to take over.
The Democratic Unionists have agreed in principle a ""confidence and supply"" deal with the Tories, who lost their majority in Thursday's election.
Wales Office Minister Guto Bebb said ""the only option"" was a Tory government with support from other parties.
Downing Street said the details of the outline deal would be discussed at a cabinet meeting on Monday.
Labour has suggested it could form a minority administration, but with 262 seats falls far short of the 326 needed for a majority in the House of Commons.
Leader Jeremy Corbyn has ruled out striking a deal with other parties.
Ms Griffith told BBC Radio Wales: ""What we really want to be about is making sure we can try, if we can, to put some of our ideas into practice, and that means being a very united group in parliament.
""It means being ready, at any moment, to take over and step into government whenever there might be a chance.
""We're still saying quite clearly that we would be ready to take over if Theresa May cannot cobble something together, and we're very doubtful that she can.
""We don't really think she has a mandate to now, she's really made a fool of herself and really, quite frankly, she should step aside and let us have a go.""
Mr Corbyn had given his party ""confidence"" about selling party policies such as public ownership of the railways, she said.
On Thursday, Labour won back three seats from the Conservatives in Wales - Cardiff North, Gower and Vale of Clwyd.
Ms Griffith said voters had switched to Labour during the election campaign itself.
""People have a real sense of community in Wales,"" she said.
""They like Labour ideas like looking after public services and I think people came together, they saw what Theresa May was offering, which was very empty - I can't really call it a manifesto - and they saw her arrogance and almost disdain for people, and they really did not like that.
""What was interesting was the number of people who made up their minds during the campaign; we saw things swinging at the very last minute.""
Last June, Ms Griffith joined a Labour rebellion against Mr Corbyn following the referendum vote for Brexit, resigning as shadow Welsh secretary in protest at what party critics claimed was his half-hearted campaign in favour of remaining in the European Union.
She returned to the front bench in October as shadow defence secretary after Mr Corbyn defeated a challenge to his leadership from Pontypridd MP Owen Smith.
Mr Bebb dismissed the idea that Labour could take power.
""It's very clear to me that the only option on the table, to be perfectly frank, is a Conservative government supported by some other parties in Westminster,"" he said.
""The DUP have voted on a fairly regular basis with the Conservative Party in the past so the nature of any agreement is something for the prime minister to work out.
""But it's not surprising that there is a possibility of a Conservative minority government being formed with the support of the DUP.  I don't find that in any way surprising.""","A senior Labour MP has called on Theresa May to step aside and ""let us have a go"" at forming a government.",40232464

Osbourne gave a video message saying how much he had enjoyed designing it and having the statue put in Birmingham.
Dr Hoot, based on Dr Who's Tardis, fetched £10,500.
Paul Larkin, a market trader in Birmingham, was part of a group which paid £8,500 for an owl called Unity Within Diversity.

STV was the only established broadcaster to apply for any of the licences.
Its Glasgow station launched last month and a sister station in Edinburgh is due to go on the air before the end of the year.
STV said that during the first month almost 30% of all viewers within the transmission area tuned in at least once. The average viewer watched the channel at least three times across the month.
In addition to the TV audience, there have been an additional 50,000 live and catch-up streams on the STV Player.

The bid seeks £826m over 10 years from the Scottish and UK governments and their agencies.
The remainder would come from councils, colleges and universities, and the public, private and voluntary sectors.
The Tay Cities Deal submission will be discussed at Angus, Dundee, Fife and Perth and Kinross councils over the coming weeks.
The final document will be submitted to both governments by the end of February.
The leaders of the region's four councils met at the James Hutton Institute in Invergowrie for the submission's formal launch.
An advanced plant growth centre and an international barley hub, both of which would involve ""significant input"" from the institute, are among the deal projects.
Iain Gaul, leader of Angus Council, said: ""The Tay Cities region will be successful for everyone who lives here.
""By working together, public and private sector partners can deliver this ambitious, creative and forward thinking programme.""
Dundee City Council leader, Ken Guild, said: ""Anchored in new and exciting ways of delivering services, we are going to create a region that is inclusive, innovative, international and connected - creating growth that combines increased prosperity with greater equity, the kind that creates opportunities for all.""
David Ross, Fife Council leader, said: ""The opportunity to negotiate a tailored deal represents a once in a generation opportunity to deliver on the Tay Cities Regional Economic Strategy and, in turn, to improve economic outcomes for everyone across the whole region.""
Ian Miller, Perth and Kinross Council leader, said: ""Our submission also has an unprecedented focus on cultural regeneration, supporting Perth's bid to be UK City of Culture 2021 and Dundee's bid for European Capital of Culture 2023.""
The Scottish government's economy secretary Keith Brown said: ""It's fantastic to see the local authorities working collaboratively to bring together this proposal.
""This partnership approach has been clearly demonstrated through the region's asks and proposed innovative projects.
""We will continue to work closely with the councils to understand and help develop their ambitious proposals.""

502,"Speaking in Beijing, Ms Sturgeon, who is on a trade visit to China and Hong Kong, said gender equality could help transform the global economy.
Addressing senior women in government, academia and business, she referred to Hillary Clinton's famous ""women's rights are human rights"" speech.
Her trip is aimed at improving Scotland's links with China.
This September will mark the 20th anniversary of the then US first lady's address at the United Nations' fourth world conference on women in the same city.
Amnesty International has accused the Chinese government of a crackdown on human rights activists and women's groups in recent months.
It follows the arrest and detention for more than a month of five female activists who were planning to mark International Women's Day in March by launching a campaign against sexual harassment.
In her remarks to an audience at the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, Ms Sturgeon said gender equality, as well as being a fundamental human rights issue, was ""one of the great economic opportunities of the 21st century"".
She said: ""There are currently well over two billion working age women across the world. But there is virtually no country, on any continent, where women have equal economic opportunities to men.
""For virtually every nation, fully empowering women is probably the single simplest way, in which they can sustainably increase their productive potential.
""Gender equality can help to transform the global economy.""
She added: ""I know that much of the work we do in Scotland will strike a chord here in China. Gender equality is incorporated in your constitution. Women account for 45% of your workforce. And you recognise the importance of women being fully involved in decision-making.
""But like all societies - certainly including Scotland - there is also more that China can do.
""To give just one example, women are still significantly under-represented among key decision-makers in business and in government.
""The truth is, that virtually all countries are on a journey towards true gender equality, but none have completely achieved it. We all need to learn from each other how best to make progress.""
Naomi McAuliffe, Amnesty International's programme director in Scotland, said: ""The first minister has made a significant statement of support for equality and human rights in Beijing, and we trust that she will continue a dialogue on these issues throughout her time in China.""",First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said China can do more to promote gender equality and women's rights.,33673100

504,"Republican Marsha Blackburn, the second-highest ranking member on the House energy committee, says the jury is still out on global warming.
Pope Francis is to speak on the subject in an address to Congress on Thursday.
He told a White House audience on Wednesday the problem could ""no longer be left to a future generation"".
Speaking earlier this year as part of a forthcoming Radio 4 documentary series ""Climate Change - Are we Feeling Lucky?"", she asserted that the earth had cooled in the last 13 years by 1F. And she said no evidence would persuade her of man-made warming.
She also rejected the theory of evolution. Scientists say her views are ""complete nonsense"".
""The jury is still out saying man is the cause for global warming, after the earth started to cool 13 years ago,"" she says.
When challenged that the earth's surface temperature had not risen substantially in 13 years - but had definitely not cooled, she said: ""I think we've cooled almost 1 degree (F).""
The earth's scientific authorities - including the US space agency Nasa - say the earth is still warming, with ice melting, sea level rising and oceans warming.
Ms Blackburn - who represents Tennessee, a big user of coal - declined to name the sources of her scepticism about mainstream science.
""We have met with different researchers,"" she says. ""We had had numerous committee meetings in which we've had individuals come to present and from all of that and what we have been able to read you come to an opinion.
""There are some that feel like human activity is the cause for carbon emissions  and because of that we need to revert to where we were in the 1870s for carbon emissions. I just choose to disagree with that.""
Asked what scientific evidence would persuade her that climate change was a threat, she replied: ""I don't think you will see me being persuaded.""
Asked whether she accepted the theory of evolution she said: ""No, I do not.""
Ms Blackburn's views matter because Republicans in Congress are trying to roll back President Obama's attempts to cut greenhouse gas emissions.
Professor Brian Hoskins, a leading climate scientist at the Royal Society said her remarks were ""absolutely staggering"".
""It is nonsense to say the world has cooled,"" Hoskins said. ""If no evidence will persuade Ms Blackburn of climate change, that shows how well-founded her views are.""
Correction 25 September 2015: An earlier version of this report implied that Marsha Blackburn's comments were made in relation to the Pope's address. They were actually given in an earlier interview and the headline and text have been amended to make this clear.

505,"And, as per normal, I am suffering from mild altitude sickness.
Here is a typical (and true) conversation with a random stranger sitting in the partners' lounge of the Davos congress centre.
""Where are you from? Your badge says India.""
""Well, I sit on the board of a big Indian institution, but I am a former minister of a Eurasian state, and I now have US citizenship, but I manage my money from a family office in London.""
Yikes. I didn't ask the size of the fortune, but the phrase ""family office"" speaks to non-trivial sums: the turmoil and wealth-creating opportunities of the globalised world, since the collapse of communism, captured in a social introduction.
And before you ask, I inserted the catch-all ""Eurasian"" to protect the anonymity of said member of the global plutocracy (them is the rules of the World Economic Forum).
As for the rest of my day so far, I have nattered to a FTSE 100 chairman, two FTSE 100 chief executives, two heads of big City institutions, a Middle Eastern philanthropist, a hedge-fund superstar and a government head.
And all meetings were serendipitous.
So, amidst the hand-wringing about what they all see as the UK's growing isolation from the EU (Davos person is genetically pro-European) and bullishness about the UK's economic recovery, in just four hours I have gathered enough story leads to keep me occupied for some time.
For a journalist of my eccentric interests, Davos is like being let loose in the sweetshop.
What is on the minds of these eminences?
Well, the most interesting conversation so far was an (unusual) on-the-record briefing for a few hacks by Japan's Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe.
Why was this gripping (and a bit scary)?
Well, he volunteered that Japan's current bad relations with China are redolent of the relationship between Britain and Germany 100 years ago, or shortly before World War 1.
Which is the sort of thing you would expect clever-clogs commentators to say (in fact they do say this), but it has more impact (ahem) when said by Japan's leader.
And, indeed, he elaborated.
He recognises that - just like Britain and Germany in 1914 - Japan and China are inter-dependent economies, trading partners with huge mutual interests.
Peace would therefore be the bulwark of their prosperity and that of the region.
But he was explicit that he saw the 10% per annum increase in China's defence budget as a provocation.
As for his controversial visit to the Yasukuni shrine, there was explanation, but no hint of regret or apology. Mr Abe simply insisted that China was wrong to see him as honouring a small number of ""war criminals"". Instead, he was paying respect to the ""souls"" of millions of other genuine Japanese war heroes.
And, by the way, Japan's title to the Senkaku Islands, which China disputes, is unimpeachable (or so Mr Abe said).
Given that Mr Abe says he wants peace with China and fears there could be ""accidents"" that shatter it, I asked him if he had a road map or plan to de-escalate the tension
Not while China pursues its military build-up, he said.
Which left me with a hollow feeling that is somewhat characteristic of encounters in this rarefied place.","So here I am, again, on the top of a Swiss mountain, surrounded by the world's wealthiest and most powerful.",25847276
506,"Tension in the area flared up a year ago when Morocco moved into the buffer zone, breaching a UN-backed ceasefire.
The Polisario Front, which wants independence for Western Sahara, dismissed Morocco's move as a gimmick.
Morocco recently rejoined the African Union, which it had left in 1984 after the body's recognition of Polisario as the territory's government.
The decision to withdraw from the Guerguerat zone is said to have been taken in person by the Moroccan King Mohammed VI.
The move came after the sovereign spoke on the phone with the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres who asked him to pull out his troops.
""The Kingdom of Morocco will proceed from today with a unilateral withdrawal from the (Guerguerat) zone,"" the Moroccan foreign ministry said in a statement.
Polisario said the move would hardly make any difference.
""The Moroccan decision to withdraw its troops near Guerguerat by a few hundred metres is window dressing,"" it said in a statement.
Western Sahara is a sparsely-populated area of mostly desert situated on the north-west coast of Africa.
It was annexed by Morocco in 1975 - a move resisted by the Polisario Front.
A 16-year insurgency ended with a UN-brokered truce in 1991 and the promise of a referendum on independence.
But this has yet to take place and Morocco still controls two-thirds of the territory, while thousands of refugees live over the border in Algeria.
Morocco's decision to withdraw its troops does not signify a major change in the kingdom's policy - it will still work towards ensuring international recognition of its claim over Western Sahara.
The announcement does, however, indicate a willingness to work with the United Nations, and in particular the new Secretary General, Antonio Guterres.
Mr Guterres' predecessor, Ban Ki-moon, infuriated Rabat by describing Morocco's annexation of Western Sahara as an ""occupation"" - a remark he later apologised for.
Morocco is rolling out a renewed campaign on Western Sahara - including joining the African Union, and King Mohammed VI making several trips to African countries.
The military withdrawal is also presumably intended to signal a willingness to compromise.
But the Polisario Front and its supporters will want to know whether that extends to giving the Sahrawi people the referendum on their future which has been delayed for so many years.","Morocco is to pull out of a UN buffer zone in the disputed Western Sahara territory, an official statement says.",39103401
507,"Crowds of people waved flags and sang Russian pop songs, delighted that, as far as their newly-installed regional government was concerned, they now live in the Russian Federation.
The law was rushed through the autonomous province's parliament, with 79 of 81 MPs backing the proposal to leave Ukraine.
There is, of course, the small matter of the region's referendum on that same question, now brought forward to 16 March.
Crimea's First Deputy Prime Minister Rustam Temirgaliev told me he was certain of victory.
""Ukrainians will become Russian citizens here"", he said. ""We will win this vote with 70 or 75%. The referendum is legitimate.""
But Kiev begs to differ. The new Ukrainian Prime Minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, has called the move ""illegitimate and with no legal basis"", as Ukraine's constitution states that any change to its borders must be approved by the whole country.
A war of words has begun between Kiev and Crimea, with the autonomous government insisting that it was the revolution in Kiev that was unlawful and that only the Crimean parliament represents the will of the people.
But how justified is the confidence of the Crimean authorities that people here want to change country?
At demonstrations like the one outside the parliament, there is a clear nationalist fervour. ""We want to go to Russia"", says one student ""not the European Union. Russians are our sisters and brothers - and this is a great idea.""
It is a widely-held view among the ethnic Russian majority here, who have staged daily pro-Russia protests against what they call the ""fascists and nationalists"" who have taken power in Kiev. Many Ukrainian Russians feel threatened by the revolution, fearful that Ukraine's new westward trajectory threatens their language and identity.
But in over a week of reporting from Crimea, I've spoken to countless Russians who feel differently - favouring greater autonomy within Ukraine, rather than wanting to switch country.
Among them are Lena and her family - ethnic Russians who welcome me to their apartment in Simferopol, their one-year-old son plays at our feet. They are determined he should grow up a Ukrainian citizen.
""I feel sad and disappointed by this move"", Lena says. ""Crimea is my homeland. I would not be happy to live in Russia - it's a foreign country for me.""
Her husband Dima would also vote no in the referendum. But, he tells me, the problem is that Crimea is still searching for its identity. ""I'm Russian but not a citizen of the Russian federation. We are different people,"" he says. ""I want to feel Crimean, but even when I type it on my computer, my spellchecker underlines it like it's not the right word.""
Crimean Russians are split, perhaps by generation. Lena's mother, Irina, remembers 1954, when Crimea was given to Ukraine by the former Soviet leader Khrushchev in a move that many here still resent. ""I would vote yes in a referendum"", she says. ""Crimea has always been a Russian land and I don't have any emotional bonds with Ukraine.""
Aside from the Russians, there is a sizeable community of ethnic Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars, who together make up around 40% of the population. They would both certainly reject changing nationality.
The Tatars were deported by Stalin to Central Asia in 1944, as punishment for alleged collaboration with the Nazis by some. Many died, and even after some eventually returned, they remained fiercely anti-Russian.
And that is the problem here. Within this small, rugged peninsula, the divisions are so deep that nothing can satisfy everyone.
For those who have only ever known an independent, united Ukraine, I found widespread opposition to a territorial break-up.
At Crimea's technical college in Simferopol, the English class has 19 students, all born after 1991, when Ukrainians voted to break away from a crumbling Soviet Union - albeit with only a slim majority in Crimea. Every single student said they wanted the province to remain as part of Ukraine and simply longed for peace.
""I was born in Ukraine, I feel Ukrainian, and I will die in Ukraine,"" says one. ""What's happening here isn't normal. I don't want Russian troops in my country.""
But it is hard to get an accurate picture of overall support for separation - or annexation - by Moscow. Crimeans have little faith in opinion polls, and with Kiev and western governments announcing the referendum won't be legal or recognised, it's not even certain to go ahead.
Crimea has thrown down the gauntlet to the Ukrainian government. The territorial integrity of the country is under threat - and Europe's borders could yet be redrawn in this disputed corner.","Outside Crimea's parliament, the leaving party for Ukraine - and the welcome celebration for Russia - had begun.",26486289

509,"You wanted to know why parts of Leicestershire have a Coventry postcode.
You asked about the origins of some unusual street names in Shropshire.
And you were curious to find out why Longton in Stoke-on-Trent was known as ""neck end"". Here is how we got on answering your questions.
Shrewsbury has many narrow, cobbled and winding streets with names including Bear Steps, Fish Street and Grope Lane.
Historian Keith Pybus said he believed it could be because the town retains a lot of old alleys.
He said while the names of larger roads were renamed for big historical events and important people, the smaller ones preserved their medieval names.
Another historian, David Trumper, said the town once had more of these medieval names, such as Ox Lane, Corvisors Row and Pig Hill, but they have either been re-named or absorbed into other streets.
He also explained that Bear Steps was named after the Bear Inn pub, which used to be there and Fish Street was named after an open air fish market.
Meanwhile, Grope Lane got its name because it's where prostitutes used to gather - use your imagination on that one.
Places like Market Bosworth, Higham on the Hill and Congerstone in Leicestershire all have a CV13 postcode which stands for Coventry.
It can cause confusion over the whereabouts of local attractions, like Twycross Zoo, which has a CV9 postcode but is within the Leicestershire border.
Royal Mail said postcodes started in 1959 to ensure the accurate sorting, routing and delivery of post and do not necessarily reflect geographical boundaries.
The postcode for a street is determined by its nearest postal town, not the county it is in.  So as parts of west Leicestershire are closer to Coventry than Leicester, they have a CV postcode.
Royal Mail said organisations who use postcode data shouldn't solely rely on the post town and recommend using other ways to identify locations.
Longton is one of the six towns which make up Stoke-on-Trent.
Richard Cresswell, president of the Longton Chamber of Trade, said the nickname came about because Longton ""rests"" at the southernmost tip of the city.
Hence it's seen by some living there as at the ""neck end"" of Stoke-on-Trent.

Three of the four best director nominees are British, while Bill Nighy and Ben Miles are in the running for best actor.
The awards will be presented on 7 June.
Musicals An American in Paris and Fun Home are the front-runners, each landing 12 nominations on Tuesday, showing two sides of the Broadway experience.
An American in Paris is a sunny, heavily-choreographed adaptation of the 1951 film; while Fun Home is a moody show based on Alison Bechdel's graphic novel about her suicidal father.
The nominations also ranged from 11-year-old Sydney Lucas in Fun Home to the 82-year-old Chita Rivera, looking for her third Tony.
British talent accounts for 24 nominations in total, with two West End transfers - Wolf Hall and The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, up for best play.
Dame Helen is recognised for her role as Queen Elizabeth II in The Audience, which imagines the private weekly meetings between the monarch and eight of her prime ministers.
She already has an Olivier Award for the London production, and an Oscar for portraying the Queen on the big screen.
""I've studied the shape of her mouth,"" said Dame Helen. ""I know her face probably better than anyone else does. But it's only my portrait,"" she said. ""I can only surmise and imagine.""
Ruth Wilson is shortlisted for her role in Constellations, the tale of a relationship playing out across alternate universes.
Her co-star Jake Gyllenhall missed out on a nomination, however, joining other notable omissions such as Larry David's Fish in the Dark; and Finding Neverland, the JM Barrie musical produced by Hollywood heavyweight Harvey Weinstein, with music by Gary Barlow.
Carey Mulligan and Bill Nighy are both nominated for Skylight, a revival of David Hare's 1995 drama, in which they play mis-matched lovers, as is co-star Matthew Beard.
Director Stephen Daldry - best known for his work on the films Billy Elliot and The Hours - is also up for best director for the play.
Daldry, who also directed The Audience, said: ""It is a fantastic day for British theatre on Broadway. I am personally thrilled for The Audience and Skylight, and delighted too for Wolf Hall and The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time""
The latter, which began life at the National Theatre, was nominated for best play, with British director Marianne Elliott also receiving a nod.
""It feels amazing,"" she told the BBC. ""We had no idea when we first started how the hell this play was going to go down. We were taking big risks, we felt. We had no idea whether there'd be an audience for it. So to see it go to Broadway is quite amazing.""
Curious Incident has six nominations in all, Skylight seven, while the RSC's double bill of Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies has eight, including a best actor listing for Ben Miles, who plays Thomas Cromwell, and best director for Jeremy Herrin.
Other notable nominees included Bradley Cooper, up for best actor for his portrayal of Joseph Merrick in The Elephant Man; and Sting, who was shortlisted for best original score, despite his musical The Last Ship closing early.
Cooper, who will perform the play in the West End next month, said: ""To be a part of a community that gathers together in a 13 block radius, eight shows a week, no matter what, in the greatest city in the world - for one sole purpose, to tell stories - I can't think of a better job to have.

522,"In the New York-based production, Julius Caesar is depicted as a blond-haired businessman in a blue suit.
The production company, Public Theater, said the character was a contemporary Caesar ""bent on absolute power"".
One of the sponsors, Delta Air Lines, said the producers had ""crossed the line on the standards of good taste"".
In the Shakespearean tragedy, which is staged in New York's Central Park, Caesar is assassinated in a lengthy scene in which he fights off his attackers before succumbing to multiple stab wounds.
The lead character's wife in the play, Calpurnia, is depicted wearing designer outfits and speaking with an apparent Slavic accent - suggesting that she is based on First Lady Melania Trump, who is Slovenian.
The company released a statement saying it stood behind its production.
""We recognise that our interpretation of the play has provoked heated discussion; audiences, sponsors and supporters have expressed varying viewpoints and opinions,"" the statement said. ""Such a discussion is exactly the goal of our civically-engaged theater"".
The company added its production in no way advocated violence and pointed out the message was that ""those who attempt to defend democracy by undemocratic means pay a terrible price and destroy the very thing they are fighting to save"".
On its website, the company states that the play is about ""how fragile democracy is,"" adding that it highlights how the ""institutions that we have grown up with can be swept away in no time at all"".

Delta said on Monday that the ""graphic staging of Julius Caesar"" at the Free Shakespeare in the Park event ""does not reflect"" the airline's values.
President Trump's son, Donald Junior, criticised the production, asking whether boundaries had been crossed in what he described as art becoming political speech.
""I wonder how much of this 'art' is funded by taxpayers?"" he tweeted, adding: ""Serious question, when does 'art' become political speech & does that change things?""
On Monday afternoon, the National Endowment of the Arts answered Mr Trump's question on its website, noting that ""no taxpayer dollars support Shakespeare in the Park's production of Julius Caesar"".
The play opened with previews on 23 May and the production is due to run until 18 June.
Delta and the other sponsor to withdraw, Bank of America, have both supported the Shakespeare season in Central Park for several years.
In a 2012 production of Julius Caesar by New York-based The Acting Company, the Roman leader was modelled on then-President Barack Obama.
Commenting on the row, Gregory Doran, the artistic director of the UK's Royal Shakespeare Company, said that Shakespeare could often surprise modern audiences with how ""relevant"" he is.
""Though he often set his plays in periods and places that were remote from his own, by doing so he could talk freely about his own society,"" he said.
""We constantly reapply that metaphor to our own times.

523,"Kathleen Ann McLeish, 60, broke her wrist when she fell while working at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary in June 2011.
The Court of Session heard that cleaners failed to put down signs warning of the wet floor.
Ms McLeish later developed a condition called complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) in her wrist.
The court was told that it caused her ""constant pain and disability"".
The experienced accident and emergency nurse is now unable to swim or play the piano and has difficulties driving.
And as a consequence of the syndrome, Ms McLeish has become depressed and put on weight.
The court was told she was prescribed medication for her depression and had to be signed off work in a bid to recover.
On Friday, in a written judgement issued at the court in Edinburgh, judge Lord Mulholland ordered Ms McLeish's employers - NHS Lothian - to pay her Â£48,206.
In it, Lord Mulholland said Ms McLeish was also unable to do her job properly.
He wrote: ""With regard to her employment she cannot do fine motor tasks such as suturing of any length and does not have the strength to manipulate broken bones back into place or conduct a physical examination which requires her to lift or move limbs.
""The injury has affected her confidence at work and her energy levels are devoted to getting through the working day.
""She does not see friends and family as much as before and is therefore more socially isolated.""
The judgement tells of how Ms McLeish, whose address has not been disclosed, is a ""very experienced"" nurse who has worked at the A&E department at ERI since 1992.
Lord Mulholland ruled that NHS Lothian breached the Workplace (Health, Safety & Welfare) Regulations 1992 in that they did not do enough to prevent the incident.
He wrote: ""I therefore conclude that the pursuer received no warning (verbal, signage or visible) that the floor was wet.

Mr Toyota and his band were among those performing and competing at the All-Ireland Fleadh Cheoil in Ennis, County Clare, on Sunday.
The event is the biggest festival of Irish music and culture in the world, and attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors every year.
Thousands compete in music competitions and Mr Toyota's group was among those taking part last weekend in Ennis. They received a warm welcome and managed to make it to the finals of one competition.
""We received a standing ovation at the end of our performance and it filled us with deep emotion,"" said the music teacher, who is travelling back to Tokyo on Tuesday.
Mr Toyota, who has no connection to the island of Ireland other than a love for the music, discovered his passion while studying the subject at university.
""People here welcome me and my band with open arms and are very warm and kind, but it is clear they are wondering why we became Irish musicians,"" he told BBC News NI.
""They assume that Japanese people would have no interest in Irish music, and they are surprised when they hear us playing the songs well.""
Mr Toyota mainly plays the flute and makes a living from teaching and performing the music at home in Japan.
He founded Toyota Céilí in 2011 and they became the first band to host regular céilí events in Japan.
Mr Toyota said traditional Irish music and dancing were becoming increasingly popular in Japan and the band welcome more than 100 people to some of their events throughout the year.
""I love to play music that people can dance along to,"" said Mr Toyota.
""When I was studying music at university, and I began my journey with Irish music, I was intrigued to learn that many Irish families played the music together - now my mother, father and younger brother accompany me often.

Checkpoint researcher Natalia Kolesova detailed information about Troldash, a newly-discovered strain.
Once it infects a machine, Troldash provides an email address with which to contact the attackers.
""While the most ransom-trojan attackers try to hide themselves and avoid any direct contact,"" Ms Kolesova explained, ""Troldesh's creators provide their victims with an e-mail address. The attackers use this email correspondence to demand a ransom and dictate a payment method.""
Troldash was distributed via a spam email - and once downloaded, immediately set to work encrypting files before placing a text file of ransom instructions on the target's computer.
Posing as a victim named Olga, the researcher contacted the scam artist, and received a reply with instructions to pay 250 euros to get the files back.
Suspecting the reply was automated, Ms Kolesova pressed for a more human response, asking more details about how to transfer the money, and pleading with the hacker to not make them pay.
Responding in Russian, the scammer offered to accept 12,000 roubles, a discount of around 15%. After Ms Kolesova pleaded further, the email response read: ""The best I can do is bargain.""
Eventually the unknown man or woman was talked into accepting 7,000 roubles - 50% less than the first demand.
""Perhaps if I had continued bargaining, I could have gotten an even bigger discount,"" Ms Kolesova concluded.

536,"The Scots, losers to Germany on Monday, need at least four points from their last two games and for other results to go their way to reach the play-offs.
Poland visit Scotland before Gordon Strachan's side travel to face Gibraltar in October's double-header.
""We will re-gather and do our utmost to win the two games,"" said McGhee.
""We still have a chance. We still feel there is enough in us to get six points from the two games to come.
""Then we have to see what happens elsewhere and that's the disappointing thing, that we're relying on other results.""
Should Scotland take four points and Republic of Ireland lose to Group D leaders Germany and then Poland, Strachan's men would beat the Irish to the play-off spot.
Another scenario that would allow Scotland to reach the play-offs involves Poland losing to Scotland and Republic of Ireland and the Scots also beating Gibraltar.
Friday's 1-0 defeat in Georgia set Scotland back compared to their Group D rivals, who all won in Tbilisi and Scotland cannot catch group leaders Germany, who are on 19 points.
McGhee believes the Scots have shown enough quality in the campaign so far to be confident that Poland can be overcome at Hampden before the final tie away to Gibraltar.
He admits, though, that addressing the poor display in Tbilisi is more important than taking positives from a better performance in the 3-2 loss to the Germans.
""We feel we can win the two games despite the performance in Georgia and the result,"" he added.
""Ireland [have the numerical advantage], although they have two hugely difficult games. Would I rather be in our position or be in Ireland's position playing against Poland and Germany? I'm not sure. Maybe we can quietly think that we're in a better position because of that.
""You've got to discount everything you saw last night. They're the world champions, the game was a spectacle, it was a fantastic occasion to have them and if we'd beaten Georgia, it would have been a carnival night, despite the result.
""We forget that performance, we have to look more closely at the Georgia performance and improve on that to beat Poland. We've played Poland already, we drew with them over there and we've had other good results. It's the elements of those games that we have to take to the Poland game.
""It was a totally different set of circumstances [against Georgia], it's not the same thing. Goals change games and Georgia got the first goal, which was critical.
""Had we got the first goal it would have been different. But they got the first goal, they played 5-4-1, it allowed them to sit in and make it really difficult for us. We weren't good enough on the night, we didn't play well enough to break them down, which was disappointing, but losing the first goal was the critical moment.""",Scotland assistant Mark McGhee insists the nation can still reach the Euro 2016 play-offs despite no longer having their destiny in their own hands.,34187414
537,"The body of Kyle Neil, 23, was discovered in the boot of a car at Windsor Road in south Belfast.
On Wednesday, Stephanie Todd, 26, of Russell Court in Belfast, pleaded guilty to obstructing police in connection with the murder.
She has also admitted driving with excess alcohol.
Her co-accused, Wesley Harry Vance, 27, formerly of Church Gate Studios in Comber pleaded guilty to Mr Neil's murder earlier this week.
Previously, Todd had denied two charges of assisting offenders by allegedly driving a car with Mr Neil's body in the boot from Mill Street, Comber to Windsor Road in Belfast on 12 April 2015 and driving the car with excess alcohol.
She was due to be tried by a jury, but following legal discussions, a new charge was added to the bill of indictment.
When Todd was charged with obstructing a constable in the execution of his duties on 12 April 2015, she replied ""guilty."" She was re-arraigned on the driving with excess alcohol charge, which she also admitted.
A prosecuting barrister said that in light of these pleas, the Crown was prepared to leave the assisting offenders charge ""on the books, not to be proceeded with"".

538,"Rail was at the heart of George Osborne's vision of a ""northern powerhouse"".
The Tory manifesto pledged: ""We will electrify the main rail routes, build the Northern Hub, and provide new trains for the North.""
Stood before a train in Crewe during the campaign, David Cameron said the government was taking unprecedented action to rebalance the economy like ""electrifying the rail lines between the main towns and cities in the north of England"".
But months before his manifesto was published, there were public warnings that electrification was in deep trouble.
In November the Office of Rail Regulation said Network Rail had missed 11 of 44 milestones.
It added: ""Looking ahead, this has raised serious questions as to how the company will deliver the ambitious programme expected in CP5 (Control Period 5), particularly the electrification projects.""
Control Period 5 - in rail jargon - runs from April 2014 to March 2019.
It also said Network Rail had overspent its budget by Â£40m in the financial year so far and the figure was due to rise to Â£112m for 2014/15.
That was the first of a series of warnings.
In December the ORR chief executive Richard Price wrote to Network Rail boss Mark Carne to warn that ""slippage on critical milestones jeopardises the delivery and timing of important benefits to passengers and freight customers"".
The warning was echoed by the chair of the ORR Anna Walker in another letter days later. The correspondence is in the public domain.
Yet another letter from the ORR that month made clear the original timetable for TransPennine electrification would slip.
The letter said: ""The original 2018 completion date for electrification works is now unlikely to be deliverable and there are uncertainties around the scope, timing and costs of the project still to be resolved.""
Network Rail itself indicated delays in its plans were coming in a document published in March.
A chapter on programmes in the North of England, including electrification plans, noted: ""We anticipate a number of revised milestone dates will be confirmed during that process and will be published in the June 2015 update.""
The Department for Transport - run then as now by Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin - hadn't failed to notice the problem.
The top civil servant servant there, permanent secretary Philip Rutnam, told a parliamentary committee in January that the challenge to deliver some electrified routes was ""very large"".
Now the electrification of the Trans-Pennine route from York to Manchester and the Midland main line from York to Sheffield has been put on hold.
The Department insists that the Midland Mainline and TransPennine electrifications have been paused - not scrapped - and the government remains committed to making them happen.
Labour suggest the public have been deceived.
They have asked whether the prime minister and his colleagues waited until after the election to reveal a crisis in rail renewal they knew about well before polling day.
For the politicians this will become a battle not only about competence on the railways, but trust in high office.","Did the Conservatives make an election promise to electrify the railways, knowing big projects would have to be put on hold?",33286270
539,"Once confirmed, he is expected to endorse a new, military-drafted constitution and to start appointing his own team of senior royal officials.
His father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the world's longest-reigning monarch, died on 13 October, aged 88.
The government has declared a year-long official mourning period.
The widely revered king had served 70 years as head of state, and was seen as a stabilising figure, promoting economic development and social harmony in a country hit by cycles of political turmoil and multiple coups.
The BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok says there have been concerns expressed quietly over how well his son will perform the same role.
Following King Bhumibol's death, he had delayed taking the crown in order to join the people in mourning.
The crown prince, who is 64, is much less well known to Thais than his father, and does not have his widespread popularity.
Our correspondent says the crown prince will start his reign under a military government that is likely to dictate Thailand's political arrangements for several more years.
He is also likely to start appointing his own advisers to senior positions in the palace hierarchy, ending the influence of a number of elderly but powerful men who had served King Bhumibol.
Strict lese-majeste laws protect the most senior members of Thailand's royal family from insult or threat. Public discussion of the succession can be punishable by lengthy jail terms.
Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha also said on Tuesday that restrictions on entertainment and television in place since the king's death would be lifted on 14 November.
He said: ""In terms of entertainment - soap operas and movies - they can go ahead. We simply ask for co-operation. Some programmes need to lower their tone.""
TV channels stopped normal broadcasting moments after the death was confirmed, and switched to broadcasts from the Grand Palace and archive footage of the royal family.
The PM said that people should still maintain decorum throughout the mourning period and refrain from wearing ""inappropriate attire"".","Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn is to be confirmed as the new king of Thailand on 1 December, a senior source has told the BBC.",37840391
540,"Dr Julie-Ann Maney was giving evidence at the trial of west Belfast man Christopher O'Neill, who denies murdering his baby daughter Cárágh .
Three-month-old Cárágh Walsh died on 7 February 2014.
She died two days after being taken to hospital from her Glasveigh Park home in Twinbrook.
Dr Maney was giving evidence on the second day of the trial at Craigavon Crown Court, sitting in Armagh, of Mr O'Neill, 26, from Whiterock Road.
It was suggested to the jury on the opening day of the trial by a prosecution counsel that a reason for the baby's death was that ""perhaps he, ( Mr O'Neill) had snapped because she was crying and he could not get her to settle, only he knows that''.
The lawyer said it was not suggested that Mr O'Neill intended to kill his baby daughter, but that being unable to quieten her, he ""must have lost self-control and that he caused those catalogue of injuries identified by the pathologists"".
Dr Maney told the trial on Wednesday that on 5 February, 2014, the hospital received a call to the red ""emergency telephone'' on the paediatric ward advising that a paramedic crew was on its way with a three-month-old baby girl who was in cardiac arrest.
When the ambulance arrived at the hospital doors, it was met by Dr Maney and her team who rushed baby Cárágh in for emergency treatment.
Dr Maney told the jury: ""At this point we took over her airways. She had agonising breathing. Her breathing was not sufficient to sustain her life.
""She needed assisted breathing. She had no heart rate. She was effectively dead.''
The consultant paediatrician said that as a result ""time was of the essence'' and her team of experts set about trying to save the baby's life.
The doctor told the trial judge that a needle was inserted into the infant's bloodstream through the bone marrow in her shin bone with ""life saving medication to restart her heart''.
""At 12.43pm her heart was resuscitated. We started to feel pulses in her groin. We listened to her heart. She had heart sounds and the chest compressions were discontinued. Her cardiovascular system was responding.""
Asked by the prosecution counsel if baby Cárágh was stablised at that stage, Dr Maney replied: ""I would say her rate had come back.
""We had taken over her breathing but she was still gravely ill. We needed to support her breathing and give her constant care and support on a life-support machine. An anaesthetist inserted a tube from her mouth to her lungs.''
Earlier, emergency medical technician Paul McParland told the jury how on 5 February, 2014, he received an emergency call to go to Glasveigh Park as an infant had taken ill.
He said that he was about to climb the steps to the second floor flat when he was met by a colleague, Mr Heaney, who was carrying baby Cárágh out in his arms.
Mr McParland said that as he made his way back to the ambulance he was ""met by a considerably highly emotional woman who tried to run towards Mr Heaney and I blocked her path''. He added that he did not know at the time that it was the baby's mother.
The court heard from the witness that the baby's father then got into the ambulance and the seriously ill baby was rushed to the Royal Victoria Hospital, arriving within five to seven minutes.
Under cross examination by a defence counsel, Mr McParland confirmed to the jury that he did not notice any marks or swelling on the baby when he attached a defibrillator to her body.

He said the travel ban - imposed for the safety of diplomats - was being lifted because it was ""unthinkable"" that the security threat was so serious.
Ethiopia last month declared a six-month state of emergency after a wave of deadly anti-government demonstrations by activists in both the Oromia and Amhara regions.

The UN peacekeeping force in the CAR has faced scores of allegations of sexual abuse and exploitation.
Almost 13,000 people are serving as part of the mission, known as Minusca.
French troops have also been accused of sex abuse in CAR. Charges were dropped against six French soldiers earlier this year, however another investigation remains open.
UN peacekeepers were deployed in 2014, with the CAR in turmoil after mainly Muslim rebels ousted President Francois Bozize, sparking a backlash from largely Christian militias.
Thousands have been killed in the violence that followed, with hundreds of thousands fleeing to neighbouring countries.
The UN said the review of the Congo-Brazzaville deployment found ""the nature and extent of existing allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse, in their totality, point to systemic problems in command and control"".
""These problems have also been compounded by issues related to the preparedness, overall discipline, maintenance of contingent-owned equipment, and logistical capacity of these troops,"" it added.

Four voters alleged he used ""corrupt and illegal practices"" in last year's election, which must now be re-run.
Mr Rahman, who denied any wrong-doing, has been banned from standing again.
At the special High Court hearing, Election Commissioner Richard Mawrey also ordered Mr Rahman to pay Â£250,000 in costs.
One of Mr Rahman's aides, Alibor Choudhury, was also found guilty of corrupt and illegal practices.
Tower Hamlets First, Mr Rahman's party, said the judgement was a ""shock"" and it was seeking further legal advice in relation to a judicial review.
Mr Mawrey - who sat as a judge - said the mayor had ""driven a coach and horses through election law and didn't care"".
In the Election Court judgement, he said the effect of his ruling that Mr Rahman's election was void meant it was as if the election ""had never taken place"" and he had not lawfully been mayor since he was re-elected for a second term on 24 May 2014.
Mr Mawrey also added: ""The evidence laid before this court...has disclosed an alarming state of affairs in Tower Hamlets.
""This is not the consequence of the racial and religious mix of the population, nor is it linked to any ascertainable pattern of social or other deprivation.
""It is the result of the ruthless ambition of one man.""
Mr Mawrey also described Bangladesh-born Mr Rahman as an ""evasive and discursive witness whose evidence was untruthful on occasion"" and suggested he had played ""race"" and ""religious"" cards.
By Karl Mercer, Political Correspondent, BBC London News
Mr Rahman's career in politics looks like it is over, unless he successfully challenges today's ruling.
But the implications of the case could be felt much wider than a courtroom on The Strand. How will the Bengali community in Tower Hamlets, many of whom voted for Mr Rahman, react? What will the judgement's impact be on community cohesion?
And for the government - should the Law Commission be asked to look at making it easier to challenge elections if there is a suspicion of fraud?
It took four local individuals in this case to risk a legal bill of hundreds of thousands of pounds to get this election overturned.
The re-run poll is likely to be on either the 7 or 11 June.
Mr Rahman ran a ""ruthless and dishonest campaign to convince the electorate his rival John Biggs was a racist"", Mr Mawrey said.
After the ruling, Labour London Assembly member, Mr Biggs, said Mr Rahman and his allies had ""robbed the people of Tower Hamlets of the free and fair mayoral election they deserved and betrayed everyone in our community who trusted and voted for him"".
The group of voters who brought the action was headed by Andy Erlam, who stood as a councillor. He said it was ""a fantastic result for democracy"".
The four voters mounted the legal challenge under the 1983 Representation of the People Act.
Their lawyers made a series of allegations, including ""personation"" in postal voting and at polling stations and ballot paper tampering.
The Election Commissioner upheld a number of the allegations, including:
Lawyers for Mr Rahman, who was re-elected for Tower Hamlets First last May, described the claims as ""invention"", ""exaggeration"" and ""in some cases downright deliberately false allegations"".
The Election Judgement said Mr Choudhury, who was also found guilty of illegal practices, must immediately vacate his seat as a councillor and a new by-election must be held in the Stepney ward.
In a statement, Tower Hamlets First said: ""The Mayor strongly denies any wrongdoing and had full confidence in the justice system and so this result has been surprising to say the least.""
Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said the Election Court's judgement justified his decision to send commissioners into the council last year to take over some operations.
He said: ""This judgement vindicates our action to intervene.""
He added the judgement against Mr Rahman could mean extra powers being handed to commissioners.

Her Majesty is expected to attend day two of the Royal Ascot race meeting on Wednesday after the State Opening earlier in the day.
Talks are continuing between the DUP and Conservatives on the details of a deal, which could see the Northern Irish party supporting the Tories on the Queen's Speech and the Budget but deciding on other issues on a vote-by-vote basis.
Mrs May is holding talks on Thursday with other Northern Ireland political parties amid concerns a DUP deal will undermine the peace process.
The prime minister was meeting separately with representatives of Sinn Fein, the Ulster Unionists, the SDLP and the Alliance Party, as well as the DUP, in Downing Street.
DUP leader Arlene Foster, who met Mrs May in No 10 on Tuesday, is understood to have returned to Northern Ireland leaving her deputy Nigel Dodds to represent the party at Thursday's meeting.
The 1998 Good Friday Agreement commits the UK and Irish governments to demonstrate ""rigorous impartiality"" in their dealings with the different political traditions in Northern Ireland.
Sinn Fein's Stormont leader Michelle O'Neill said: ""I will be making it very clear that any deal between the Tories and the DUP cannot be allowed to undermine the Good Friday and subsequent agreements.""
Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire insisted the government would honour its commitments in the Good Friday Agreement and warned that time was running out if power sharing was to be restored and a return to direct rule from Westminster avoided.
""An agreement to restore devolved power-sharing government in Stormont must be reached by the 29 June deadline,"" he said.","The State Opening of Parliament and Queen's Speech will take place next Wednesday, Commons leader Andrea Leadsom has announced.",40285953

554,"The temporary closure of the Carlisle site hit supplies of McVitie's ginger nuts, Crawford's custard creams and Carr's water biscuits, among others.
United Biscuits said there had been ""substantial flood damage"" to electrical equipment and ovens.
Manufacturing director Mark Taylor said customers had written to ask when the biscuits would be back on shelves.
How have we coped without biscuits?
A number of shoppers ""rather than buy another pack, they actually hunted down the store manager, harangued him for 10 minutes about why ginger nuts weren't there and left the shop without buying anything"", he said.
Storms Desmond and Eva caused widespread damage in Cumbria, Lancashire and Yorkshire.
Nearly 40 million litres of water and 540 tonnes of debris had to be cleared before normal production at the Carlisle site could resume, the company said.

555,"The 1-in-50 scale miniature was created to test planned improvements to the beach and sea defences.
Specialists HR Wallingford built it at the company's research centre in Oxfordshire.
Tom Rigden, of the firm, said: ""Computer models are improving all the time, but there's still no substitute for a physical model.""
Conwy council, which commissioned the model, wants to extend the sandy beach from the centre of Colwyn Bay around to Rhos-on-Sea.
However, it needs to test how much sand is needed and how long it will stay in place before the waves wash it away.
Benji Poulton, the council's project manager, said: ""Bringing in the sand is a very expensive operation, so we need to be sure that when we did bring in the sand, it will stay in the area where we put it.
""Having a model built will test the theories for a fraction of the price and give us the chance to optimise our design before we go ahead.""
In 2013, the council brought half a million tonnes of sand to the beach, close to Colwyn Bay town centre.
The results of this experiment will help it to do similar work with a new section of seafront and to improve the beach and the sea defences around to Rhos-on-Sea.
The model includes wave-making machines, a replica coastline and even a miniature version of Rhos-on-Sea breakwater and slipway.
Mr Rigden, of HR Wallingford, said: ""It's a 1-in-50 scale model - that means one metre in our model is equivalent to 50 metres in the real world.
""The coast is extremely complicated. The physical processes with waves, sea bed and sea shore are complex, and the forces involved are immense.
""The best way to get an idea of what is happening is to build this scale model, which allows us to test all the forces, all the processes in one go.""","Scientists have built a scale model replica of Colwyn Bay seafront, hundreds of miles from the sea.",39143440
556,"Officers have also targeted but not fire Tasers at 13-year-olds, Freedom of Information statistics requested by the Greater London Authority (GLA) Conservatives show.
The Tories said officers should use cameras connected to their Tasers to protect ""the most vulnerable"".
The Met said recent figures had showed a reduction in the use of Tasers.
Andrew Boff, leader of the GLA Conservatives, has called for officers to start using new body-worn cameras on their uniforms that are designed to activate automatically when the Taser is taken from its holster.
The Los Angeles Police Department already use cameras to record Taser incidents and the Met Police are currently trialling body cameras across 10 London boroughs, but they a not activated when Tasers are used.
Mr Boff said Tasers were ""an important tool in public safety,"" but without context their use on the elderly or children was ""questionable.""
He said: ""Body-worn cameras triggered by the use of the Taser would capture the events leading to a needed intervention.
""They have been shown to increase accountability whilst reducing complaints, protecting both police officers and the most vulnerable in society.""
Tasers fire two darts with a five-second, 50,000-volt charge, which can temporarily disable its target.
The Met's website states the devices have been used by specially trained officers as an additional option to manage situations where violence is threatened or likely from a safe distance.
The Freedom of Information data obtained by Mr Boff showed in 2013 and 2014, Tasers were:
In 2013 and 2014, the Met used Tasers in 4,105 incidents, including firing them 503 times, according to figures.
The Met said the most recent Home Office figures showed there had been a reduction of 11.7% in the use of them.
The figures from October 2014 said Tasers had been fired 992 times from January to June 2014, compared to 1124 times from July to December 2013.
A Met Police spokesman added: ""The MPS currently has in the region of 1,000 body-worn video cameras deployed as part of a year-long pilot.

Shaun Whalley's penalty gave the Shrews hope but Forest held on to progress.

560,"The Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) has agreed to approve the treatment, which is known as Prep.
Scientists have found that a daily dose of the drug can protect people at risk of contracting the virus.
It means Scotland will become the first place in the UK to routinely offer Prep to eligible patients.
Campaigners welcomed the SMC's decision, describing it as a ""bold step"" which could lead to a reduction in the spread of the virus.
They estimate that up to 1,900 people north of the border could benefit from the drug, which has the brand name Truvada and costs about £450 a month.
The anti-retroviral drug is already licensed for use by people diagnosed with HIV in Scotland.
However, the SMC's decision relates to its use on a preventative basis by people who do not have the virus.
The group said Prep was one aspect of a wider HIV prevention strategy and it should be used in combination with safe sex practices such as using condoms.
SMC chairman Dr Alan MacDonald said: ""[Prep] when used together with safer sex practices may help to reduce the spread of HIV, which is an ongoing priority for the Scottish government.""
It was one of series of drugs approved by the body, including Kadcyla, which is used to treat aggressive and advanced types of breast cancer.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (or Prep for short) is a small, blue pill.
The pill works by protecting cells in the body and disabling the virus to stop it multiplying - should it enter the body.
Taking it once a day has been found to reduce the risk of HIV infection by 86%.
It is currently used in the US, Canada, Australia and France to help protect gay men at the highest risk of contracting HIV.
The decision on Prep was welcomed by a group of charities, including HIV Scotland and the Terrence Higgins Trust Scotland, which had campaigned as The Prep4Scotland Coalition.
In a statement, they said: ""We applaud the SMC for taking this bold step to tackling HIV in Scotland.
""Prep provides opportunities to reinvigorate how people at higher risk of HIV exposure engage with testing and prevention opportunities, and it is a vital opportunity to make a real reduction in the number of new HIV transmissions.
""All NHS Boards in Scotland need to now follow the SMC's advice and ensure they're making Prep available to those who need it, so that no-one at risk is left behind.""
Robert McKay, the national director for the Terrence Higgins Trust Scotland, said the move could save the health service thousands of pounds.
""Today, Scotland has made history in the fight against the HIV epidemic,"" he said.
""Prep can now be used as a vital tool - alongside condom use, regular testing and early treatment - to help bring an end to HIV transmission in Scotland.
""Not only will this make a life-changing difference to individuals by protecting them from a lifelong and stigmatised condition, but for every person who would have become HIV positive without Prep, NHS Scotland will save £360,000 in lifetime treatment costs.""
Earlier, HIV Scotland's chief executive George Valiotis said that there was a growing demand for the treatment in Scotland.
He estimated that ""a couple of dozen"" Scots are already using variants of the drug after buying generic versions online.
Watty Gaffney is one of about ""a couple of dozen"" people in Scotland already thought to be buying generic versions of Prep online.
""I started taking it at the turn of the year. I'd been thinking about it for some time.  I'd been reading up on Prep and what that means for people.
""It is essentially a preventative treatment for HIV. It seemed the natural way to move forward.
""You come into contact with people throughout your life. You don't know their history. You want to protect yourself and it seemed like the appropriate thing to do.""
HIV Scotland believes the use of Prep has played a part in reducing the number of HIV infections in Scotland.
The latest figures from Health Protection Scotland show 285 new cases of HIV were reported in 2016, down from an annual average of 359 over the last five years.
The manufacturer of Truvada, Gilead, applied to the SMC after they were urged to do so by the Scottish government last year.
It followed a series of legal battles in England over whether the NHS or local authorities should pay for the medication.
The Court of Appeal eventually ruled that NHS England had the power to fund the drug,
The decision did not mean that NHS England had to fund Prep but in December it announced plans for a large scale clinical trial of the drug, expected to involve 10,000 participants over three years.","A ""game-changing"" drug which dramatically reduces the chances of being infected with HIV is to be made available on the NHS in Scotland.",39552641
561,"They appear to have been killed by a missile fired by Houthi rebels at troops from the Saudi-led coalition seeking to restore Yemen's government.
Rebel and government sources said the attack, in the province of Taiz, left dozens of coalition troops dead.
The incident comes ahead of UN-brokered peace talks in Switzerland on Tuesday.
The government says a seven-day ceasefire will begin at midnight (21:00 GMT) to coincide with the talks.
The Saudi state news agency quoted a coalition statement as saying Saudi Col Abdullah al-Sahyan and Emirati officer Sultan al-Ketbi were killed early on Monday while ""carrying out their duties in following up the progress of operations of liberating"" Taiz province.
Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya TV said Col Sahyan was the head of Saudi special forces there.
The coalition provided no details about how the two officers died, but local media and Yemeni sources said they were killed in a rocket or missile strike south-west of the contested city of Taiz.
A pro-government military source told the Reuters news agency that the rocket hit at a camp housing Yemeni, Sudanese, Emirati and Saudi troops in the Dhubab area, near the strategically important Bab al-Mandab strait through the Red Sea, and that ""tens were killed"".
The pro-Houthi Saba news agency cited a rebel statement as saying they had fired a Soviet-era Tochka missile at a ""command centre run by the enemy"". The attack caused ""many losses in lives and military equipment"", including Apache helicopters, the statement added.
If confirmed, the attack would be the deadliest on the coalition since 45 Emirati troops were killed when a Tochka missile hit a base in Marib province, east of the capital, Sanaa, in September.
At least 5,700 people, almost half of them civilians, have been killed in air strikes and fighting on the ground since the Saudi-led coalition launched a military campaign in March after the Houthis seized Sanaa and advanced towards the second city of Aden.
The already dire humanitarian situation in Yemen has also deteriorated severely, with more than 21 million people - four-fifths of the population - now requiring aid.
Since March, coalition and pro-government forces have retaken Aden and the city of Marib, but have failed to drive the rebels out of the third city of Taiz.","A Saudi military commander and an Emirati officer are reported to be among a number of Gulf, Yemeni and Sudanese soldiers killed in Yemen.",35091675

564,"BBC Sport has learned Infantino will meet Robert Torres, a member of the investigatory chamber of the Fifa ethics committee.
The interview in Zurich - possibly as early as Friday - is part of a preliminary probe.
If there is sufficient evidence then a full investigation could be opened.
Under such circumstances Infantino could be suspended from his role for up to 90 days.
The allegations relate to a possible conflict of interest when using private jets laid on by a World Cup-bidding country; that he filled senior posts without checking people's eligibility for the role; and billing Fifa for mattresses, flowers, an exercise machine and personal laundry.
A Fifa spokesperson told BBC Sport: ""The Fifa president has stated publicly he fully respects the independence and work of the ethics committee and that he would provide, if required, whatever information necessary to facilitate any potential review by the committee.
""The president has made clear that he has acted appropriately and in accordance with Fifa's code of ethics.""
Infantino is said to be ""very confident"" that no further action will be taken with sources close to the former Uefa secretary general describing the allegations as ""absurd"" and ""baseless"".
External legal counsel is said to have been hired by Fifa to provide an independent assessment of the claims against Infantino. It is believed to have concluded he has no case to answer.
The same sources have described the allegations as part of a ""vendetta"" against Infantino by unnamed people who have recently left Fifa. Documents, it is claimed, have been deliberately leaked in order to destabilise the man elected to the top job in world football in February.

Fifa has been hit by a spate of high profile departures in recent months.
Domenico Scala resigned as Fifa's head audit and compliance in May while the governing body's one time finance director and acting secretary general, Markus Kattner, was sacked that same month amid allegations of financial impropriety.
Kattner was fired after the discovery of a secret bonus scheme which paid him millions of dollars over a period of years.
A number of other employees have left, or are expected to leave, following a major restructuring within Fifa's Zurich headquarters.
A further 18 potential witnesses are understood to have been questioned as part of the preliminary probe into Infantino.
Torres is said to be leading the investigation given that the chairman of the ethics investigatory chamber, Cornel Borbely, and Infantino are both Swiss nationals.
The interview by investigators follows the leaking, to German media, of an internal Fifa memo.
Infantino was alleged by an unnamed Fifa insider to have used private jets during a trip to visit the 2018 and 2022 World Cup hosts Russia and Qatar, raising questions of a potential conflict of interest.
Fifa organised the flight to Moscow but an airline transfer to Doha was not available following a late change in the schedule by his Russian hosts.
Infantino and his staff then travelled by private jet, arranged by the Russians. The Gulf state in turn organised the return trip to Switzerland.
There have also been reports in Swiss and German media that Infantino, after attending the Champions League Final in Milan in May, flew on to Rome for an audience with the Pope. He then returned to Geneva.
Media playback is not supported on this device
But sources say that flight will be argued not to be a breach of Fifa's code of ethics given it was a private arrangement with a family friend who is unconnected to football.
The leaked internal document also alleges that Infantino demanded Fifa hire an external driver, who then billed the governing body for driving Infantino's family and advisors around while he was abroad.
It also details costs authorised by Infantino of:
•£8,795 for mattresses at his home
•£6,829 on a stepper exercise machine
•£1,086 for a tuxedo
•£677 on flowers
•£132 on personal laundry
It also makes reference to how many of the candidates chosen by Infantino to fill senior posts had not passed the relevant eligibility checks, including the new Fifa secretary general, Fatma Samoura.
But Infantino believes the case will be dismissed given the relevant facts.
For example, it's understood Infantino wanted a bed removed from an office space previously occupied by Sepp Blatter. The former Fifa president is understood to have been partial to an afternoon nap on occasion.
In its place Infantino asked for a step machine, with an expectation one would be brought in from Fifa's on-site gymnasium.
Instead, officials purchased a new one with the resultant invoice being used by Infantino's enemies, according to sources, to damage him.
The Swiss-Italian is also under pressure for failing to sign an employment contract, with reports of a dispute between him and Scala, who helped set pay levels, over his salary.

Leigh Halfpenny kicked all of Wales' points, converting four of his five penalty kicks before going off injured.
South Africa were limited to two Pat Lambie penalties as Wales largely contained the Springboks attacking threat.
The tourists had a late five-metre scrum but the Wales pack disrupted the set-piece to seal a famous win.
Perhaps of more concern, however, was the injury to captain Jean de Villiers, who was carried off having dislocated his kneecap.
Much of the build-up to the match featured Wales coach Warren Gatland fielding questions about whether he was under pressure because of losses this series to Australia and New Zealand, taking his record to just one win in 27 matches against the southern hemisphere big three.
This win, to add to Wales' previous victory over South Africa in 1999 - also at the Millennium Stadium - provided a perfect riposte and kick-starts their build-up to next year's World Cup in England.
Opposite number Heyneke Meyer had not been under quite the same scrutiny, although their 29-15 defeat by Ireland in their opening tour game had raised some questions that were answered in subsequent wins over England and Italy.
Both sides were missing players because of injuries and recalls to clubs, as this match took place outside World Rugby's official international window.
With George North concussed, Liam Williams stepped into the vacant Wales wing slot, given the opportunity to redeem himself after conceding the last-gasp penalty try that denied them victory in June's second Test in Nelspruit.
Gatland had also suffered a run of injuries among his loose-head props, while Paul James had to depart back to Bath, but he could still call on British and Irish Lion Gethin Jenkins to fill the number one shirt.
Hooker Richard Hibbard had also been recalled to Gloucester, while South Africa had to change their entire back three with wing Bryan Habana and full-back Johan Goosen returning to France and JP Pietersen departing for Japan.
Wales full-back Halfpenny and Springboks fly-half Lambie exchanged early penalties, with Halfpenny unfortunate to hit the outside of the post with a later effort.
Space for the backs to work in was at a premium in a hotly contested first half, with both sides up quickly with some typically fierce defence.
Wales' best moments came from chips ahead to turn the Springboks, the tactic enjoying particular success down the left wing.
Twice Williams came close to collecting the bouncing ball to plunge over the try line, but each time Lwazi Mvovo was there a split-second before, covering across to snuff out the danger.
South Africa almost broke the deadlock when Eben Etzebeth surged through the midfield, but he knocked on as the lock was scythed down by Halfpenny's thumping tackle on the 22-yard line.
Lambie missed a long-range penalty that would have sent the Boks into the changing rooms with a narrow half-time lead, leaving the match delicately poised at the halfway stage.
Halfpenny and Lambie again exchanged early penalties after the restart, with the Springbok stand-off showing his range by slotting from the halfway line.
Wales enjoyed the best period of the game after that, keeping the ball in hand to pressurise the visitors into conceding two more penalties that Halfpenny converted.
Through all of this, the Wales half-back partnership of Rhys Webb and Dan Biggar shone, using possession wisely and keeping a level of control that South Africa found hard to wrest away.
Meyer used his bench early, making four changes including putting Handre Pollard on at fly-half in place of Lambie.
But the Springboks coach was forced into another change soon when captain De Villiers was carried off, replaced by Damian de Allende.
South Africa suffered a further blow when Cornal Hendricks was sin-binned for taking out Halfpenny in the air.
The Wales 15 was clearly shaken by the collision and left the field soon after, with Scott Williams coming on and Liam Williams switching to his preferred full-back position.
Spurred on by their man advantage, Wales laid siege to the Springboks line but met furious resistance as first Jamie Roberts and then Scott Baldwin were stopped just short.
In the closing minutes, South Africa earned a five-metre scrum that threatened to undo all Wales' hard work and deliver another gut-wrenching late loss to a southern hemisphere side.
But the Wales pack rose to the challenge, making a mess of South Africa's platform and allowing the ball to be cleared upfield.
Wales kept their heads and kept the Springboks at bay for the final few moments to seal a well-deserved, and long overdue, win.

567,"Norman was on loan to Allen Smith, 65, when he took flight from his workplace in Flitwick on 9 January.
The bird, who boasts a 6ft (1.8m) wingspan, was found at midday on Monday on an industrial estate in Barton-le-Clay.
Mr Smith, who caught him using a dead wild rabbit as bait, said he was ""over the moon"".
The handler said when Norman grabbed hold of the meat he managed to get hold of the straps that were still on his feet and put him in his car.
""He is now sat in the back of the car as if nothing has happened,"" he said.
""The help [finding him] has been fabulous and the response fantastic.""
Norman had evaded capture despite numerous sightings in the past two weeks.
After making his escape, the bird, who stands roughly 3ft (0.9m) tall, was spotted in Stewartby, about five miles from Flitwick and Lidlington, before being seen roosting in a tree at Center Parcs, near Flitwick, on 16 January.
Mr Smith walked around the site but did not see him.

569,"Fran D'Alcorn, of the independent St Felix School, in Southwold, Suffolk, suggested the sector as a whole could provide places for a thousand children.
The UK will accept up to 20,000 Syrian refugees over the next five years.
And Miss D'Alcorn said the orphans among them would put pressure on local authorities, children's homes and fostering services.
Boarding schools could offer them pastoral support as well as a good education, she said.
In World War One, St Felix had helped children from Serbia, she said. In the 1930s, it had taken in refugees from the Kindertransport, which brought children from Nazi Germany. And in the late 1970s, the school had taken in children of the so-called Vietnamese boat people.
Boarding Schools' Association national director Robin Fletcher said: ""We know educating the next generation is key to the future success of any country, not least a war-torn country such as Syria.
""Our boarding communities can provide a safe haven in which the refugees can have access to a strong network of pastoral support and structure including counsellors while continuing their education.""",A boarding school head offering two free places to orphaned Syrian refugees is urging others to do the same.,34174797
570,"He beat 34,000 applicants to secure the position, which came with a A$150,000 salary and a luxury villa on Hamilton Island, in Queensland.
Mr Southall took up the role accompanied by his then girlfriend and spent the next six months travelling around and promoting the area.
Nearly three years later what is he up to now?
When the charity fund-raiser, from Petersfield, in Hampshire, headed out to the Whitsunday Islands he was already a seasoned traveller who had completed solo expeditions around Africa.
Mr Southall flew to Australia to take up an unusual job sampling the tourism attractions dotted around the Great Barrier Reef.
Part of his role involved updating a blog with photos, videos and diary entries documenting his experiences to help promote the area as a tourist destination worldwide.
But the job itself was not what he first imagined it would be.
""At the time I saw the advert I thought it would be like living on a desert island like Tom Hanks in Castaway,"" he said.
""It became bigger the further it went on. It was after I won when I did a 10-minute slot on the Oprah Winfrey show which was broadcast in 140 countries that I thought 'This is pretty big now'.""
The work led to long hours as Mr Southall, who is now 37, tried to visit as much of the region as he could.
He said: ""I put in a lot of work, it should have been entitled 'the busiest job in the world'.
""Every day was a different experience: jet skiing, staying in five-star resorts, diving - and then writing about it.
""I self-imposed too much on myself because I've got a strong work ethic.
""There are 150,000 people working in tourism in Queensland so the pressure was quite high because of the responsibility I felt for them.""
The job was also not without its risks - not least when Mr Southall was stung by a Irukandji jellyfish, whose venomous sting can be lethal.
But despite the pressures and the brush with one of Australia's deadly creatures, overall his experience was positive.
And while many claimed the job was a  
          PR stunt
 Mr Southall took the role seriously, evidently impressing his employers who he now works for as a ""tourism ambassador"".
The role sees him promoting the entire state instead of just the area around the Great Barrier Reef.
He said: ""It means I'm travelling more around the state of Queensland, into the outback, the rainforest and down to the Gold Coast.
""I'm a roving reporter, I produce and shoot video content and run a blog.""
He has also done a six-part series with National Geographic and was involved in an Australian children's show called Totally Wild.
But he had not undertaken a large-scale expedition since his time in Africa and was missing the challenge of a bigger project so in May 2011 he set off on ""the best expedition in the world"".
The adventurer paddled, pedalled and sailed 1,600km over four months in a ""Hobie"" kayak from the town of 1770 to Cooktown along the Great Barrier Reef - retracing the route Captain James Cook took more than 240 years ago.
""I wanted to show people the Great Barrier Reef is alive and well - people think it has died off,"" he added.
The expedition has kept his wanderlust alive and he would like to go on further adventures around Asia.
But unlike his solo travels around Africa he is unlikely to undertake his next trip alone as later this year he will get married.
He said: ""I came out here in a relationship, that finished a couple of years ago.
""I was over here by myself then 18 months ago I was at a tourism event and I met Sophee.""
The two became engaged and in November the pair will head to Hamilton Island, Mr Southall's first home in Australia, for their wedding.
Looking back on the past three years he said: ""I didn't expect to stay out here. I've always travelled and had wanderlust. This is the longest time I've stayed in one place.
""Four years ago I was travelling around Africa in a Land Rover. Now I live in Brisbane which is a city, not a very big city but I'd never done city living before.""
He said he thought that if he had not won the competition he would have carried on splitting his time between working in the UK and travelling to hard-to-reach places.
""The job has allowed me to have adventures and keep exploring, write about it and learn new skills like filming, editing, presenting, public speaking and TV work,"" he said.
""They're great things to have done and if it wasn't for the competition I don't think I'd have done them.""","In 2009 Ben Southall landed ""the best job in the world"" as caretaker of an Australian tropical island.",17690978
571,"Seventy people a year are killed, and hundreds of thousands are injured, as a result of fires in cookers, fridges and tumble driers.
The Electrical Safety Council(ESC) said manufacturers need to do more to trace their customers if they need to warn them about safety issues.
It said the current guidelines are not good enough.
Last December Catherine Paterson, from Middlesbrough, had a fire that destroyed her garage.
The fire started in her tumble drier, which was only four months old.
She later found out after searching on the internet that the model she was using had a problem and had been recalled by the manufacturer.
""About ten minutes after the drier was switched on we got a call from the neighbour, who told us the garage was on fire,"" she told the BBC.
The fire was so fierce that it destroyed the garage in fifteen minutes, and caused Â£10,000 worth of damage.
""They knew the product was faulty since the end of November but no one got in touch,"" said Catherine.
It was beginning of February when someone got in touch to let us know that there was something wrong.""
That was two months after the fire.
According to Trading Standards, the manufacturer of the tumble drier that Catherine owned did everything it could to tell people that the product was faulty.
That included putting notices in the media and online.
But Steven Curtler, product safety manager at the Electrical Safety Council (ESC), said Catherine's case highlights how current guidelines for manufacturers are not good enough. He is now calling for changes need to be made to industry procedures to ensure peoples' safety.
""One area we believe there could be significant improvement is in the traceability of products,"" he said.
The ESC wants more information about consumers to be taken at the point they buy the appliance.
""The more information you have about the person who has purchased that product the easier it will be to provide critical information about the safety of the product,"" he added.
According to figures from the ESC, on average 70 people die and 350,000 people are seriously injured every year by household items like fridge freezers, gas cookers and washing machines.
In 2011 six members of the same family, a mother and her five children, were killed in north London, when a fridge freezer caught fire.
The London Fire Brigade told the BBC that fridge freezers are the most dangerous household appliance when involved in a fire.
The problem is at the back of the fridge where there is a large amount of foam insulation, which is highly flammable.
The London Fire Brigade warned that if people notice any strange noises coming from their fridge or freezer , they should call the manufacturer or an electrical repair expert immediately.","Safety experts have called for better standards, to protect consumers from faulty goods that can catch fire.",21630150
572,"Michael ""Mikey"" Williamson and Martin Shaw, who were both 23 and living in Inverness, were found dead within days of each other in October.
Family and friends fear the young men took their own lives.
Mikeysline will offer support via text messages and will be staffed by volunteers.
Jamie-Lyn McBride, a friend of the two men, said: ""There is not enough support in the north of Scotland for young people contemplating suicide, or just don't know how to cope with how they are feeling.""
Michael Williamson's uncle, Ron Williamson, said one of the aims of the new service would be to make people know that they were not alone in struggling with their emotions, or troubles in their lives.
He said: ""The people who think they are alone don't know that the person standing next to them in the supermarket queue, or the girl in the corner desk, or the guy in the pub cracking the jokes are also suffering.
""By getting this out there, people their own age can talk to them.""

574,"Tom Naylor put the Brewers in front in the first half after the hosts failed to clear a corner.
Burton doubled their lead with Ben Fox's glancing header after 70 minutes.
Lee Tomlin's cross from a free-kick crept in at the back post to halve Cardiff's deficit, but their late push for an equaliser was in vain.
Four league wins from four - including an opening victory at Burton - had put Cardiff top of the Championship table, and their manager Neil Warnock demonstrated where his priorities lay by making 10 changes from Saturday's triumph at Wolves.
Burton made seven changes of their own from Friday's league win over Birmingham, and it was one of the surviving four, Naylor, who gave them the lead with a calm, low finish after 26 minutes at Cardiff City Stadium.
The visitors were coasting to victory when Fox headed in their second and, although Tomlin's goal inspired a strong finish from Cardiff, Burton held on.
Cardiff City manager Neil Warnock said: ""I'm disappointed but not heartbroken.
""It's a blessing that we've not picked up any injuries.
""At 1-0 I though about Mendez and Loic and at 2-0 I didn't want to put them on. Then we scored. But we had enough chances didn't we?
""I can't blame the ref for either of the goals but I think it was his first game at this level and I thought he was poor. It's a good job it wasn't a league match.
Burton Albion boss Nigel Clough said: ""I thought it was a very good performance. The only thing we're disappointed with is we ended up hanging on at the end.
""The chances we had, we should have been maybe three goals ahead and then it wouldn't have mattered.
""It's a completely different team. Cardiff have rested 10 players and rightly so, when you're top of the league. I'm afraid that's of far greater importance than the cup.""

575,"Chelsea dominated the majority of the 90 minutes, though their goal was fortuitous, with Lee Cattermole poking the ball into his own goal.
The Blues seemed to be heading to the last four until a late Fabio Borini equaliser took the match to extra time.
From then on the Premier League strugglers were the better side with Ki Sung-Yueng's thumping winner deserved.
Extra time was a scenario Jose Mourinho would have dreaded as the Chelsea manager had already been lamenting his team's packed schedule, pointing out that league leaders Arsenal had a few days extra to prepare for Monday's Premier League fixture between the two sides.
But Chelsea, who wasted a number of opportunities in a match they dominated for long periods, only had themselves to blame for prolonging what had been a tedious match up until Borini's dramatic strike.
The tireless Black Cats frustrated a Chelsea side which was much changed from the one which beat Crystal Palace in the league on Saturday. But whatever personnel the Portuguese chooses, it continues to be the same story for a team which has too often been toothless this season.
Despite an array of attacking talents in the Chelsea squad, it seems Mourinho has no-one at his disposal with the ruthlessness to kill off a game, with the former Real Madrid man particularly critical of his strikers of late.
Mourinho began with Willian, Samuel Eto'o and Andre Schurrle leading the attack and when those three failed he brought on Demba Ba and Eden Hazard towards the end of the second half, but neither made an impression.
Sunderland will be bottom of the Premier League on Christmas Day regardless of their achievements in the League Cup.
But manager Gus Poyet regarded this quarter-final as an opportunity to galvanize his players for the club's fight for top-flight survival, and the Uruguayan will surely be heartened by his players' character and courage during what was a demanding 120 minutes.
Media playback is not supported on this device
Willian, who had the freedom to float around the pitch, was the away team's most potent player and had the best chance of the first half when he dragged his effort wide of the far post.
Mark Schwarzer was underemployed in the Chelsea goal. A penalty appeal for a Cesar Azpilicueta handball was all the sparse 20,000 crowd had to shout about until Borini rewrote the script.
Chelsea had far more zip in the second half, with Cattermole's own goal giving the visitors the boost they needed.
Goal decision system technology was used before deciding whether to allow the goal, and replays also showed that Cattermole, rather than Frank Lampard, had the final touch as both players slid goalwards in chase of Azpilicueta's fine cross.
The own goal was Sunderland's sixth of the season - an ever-increasing number which has already left manager Poyet cursing his players' positioning rather than bad luck.
It was all Chelsea as Eto'o, Schurrle and Ba went close to doubling the visitors lead, but the Londoners were not clinical enough and paid the price as Borini squeezed the ball home to force the match into extra time.
From then on the momentum was with Sunderland. The Italian scuffed a further two chances, while a brilliant one-handed save from Schwarzer prevented Ki's diving header from finding the net.

576,"The Labour leader called for a dialogue in the country, where more than 120 people have died during months of anti-government protests.
He has been under pressure to condemn President Nicolas Maduro, after voicing support for him in the past.
Mr Maduro has been accused of behaving like the ""dictator of an evil regime"" by Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.
In the latest developments, Mr Maduro said a search was under way in Venezuela for 10 men who escaped with weapons after an attack on a military base.
Mr Corbyn has previously supported the Venezuelan government under both socialist president Hugo Chavez and his successor Mr Maduro.
As a backbencher he attended a 2013 vigil following the death of Mr Chavez, hailing him as an ""inspiration to all of us fighting back against austerity and neo-liberal economics in Europe"". He also shared a platform with Mr Maduro in 2006.
Speaking in Crawley, West Sussex, where he was attending a meeting of Labour Party members, Mr Corbyn said: ""I'm very sad at the lives that have been lost in Venezuela. The people who have died, either those on the streets or security forces that have been attacked by people on the street - all of those lives are terrible for the loss of them.
""There has to be a dialogue and a process that respects the independence of the judiciary and respects the human rights of all.""
Asked whether he condemned Mr Maduro's actions, Mr Corbyn said: ""What I condemn is the violence that's been done by any side, by all sides, in all this.
""Violence is not going to solve the issue. The issues in Venezuela are partly structural because not enough has been done to diversify the economy away from oil - that has to be a priority for the future.""
He added that ""effective and serious attempts at reducing poverty in Venezuela"" should be recognised.
Speaking on BBC Newsnight, Juan Andrés Mejía, founding member and national director of one of the main Venezuelan opposition parties, Popular Will, said: ""What I would say to to Jeremy Corbyn is that he really has to know what's going on in our country to be able to make a statement.
""Violence has not been done by both sides. Violence has been promoted by the government.""
Labour MP John Spellar, a member of a new Parliamentary group on Venezuela who has been a critic of Mr Corbyn, said: ""We should be clearly on the side of Venezuelan freedom and should be calling for respect for the clear mandate of the freely elected national assembly and the freeing of all political prisoners.
""That should be the position of the Labour Party.""
Former deputy prime minister Lord Prescott told the BBC Mr Corbyn did not ""run away"" from opinions he had previously expressed about Venezuela, adding that it was important to ""reassess when there are new circumstances"".
Rival parties criticised Mr Corbyn's response to questions about the country.
Conservative MP Henry Smith attacked his ""failure to condemn Venezuela's strangulation of democracy and descent into chaotic poverty"" while Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable added: ""The leadership of the Labour Party must make it abundantly clear that they have ended their infatuation with the Venezuelan regime.""","Jeremy Corbyn has said he is ""very sad"" at lives lost in Venezuela and condemned violence done ""by any side"".",40853378

She spoke as the UK and France agreed a deal further improving security around Calais.
She said ministers were also in talks with Belgium and the Netherlands about security at their ports.
Commons Home Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz echoed Mrs May, highlighting the ""dangers of the domino principle"" and saying that closing one route ""will only mean the problem moves to another port"".
He said agreements needed to be in place with countries across Europe's north coast to prevent that.
Migrants camped in and around Calais have been making nightly attempts to reach the UK, often by boarding lorries heading for the port or the Eurotunnel.
Mrs May, who toured the Eurotunnel site in Coquelles earlier, said it had been a ""difficult summer"" with high levels of migrant activity and strike action in Calais.
But she said joint efforts with the French government were working.
She said France and the UK would also work with other EU states to try to ensure there were ""fully functioning external borders and an asylum system that is resistant to abuse"".
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said asylum seekers should be welcomed ""with dignity"", but illegal immigrants would not be tolerated.
The joint deal sets out measures including an extra 500 police from the UK and France, additional freight search teams, including sniffer dogs, and UK-funded flights to return migrants to their home countries.
The plan also includes a ""control and command centre"" that will be jointly run by British and French police and will ""relentlessly pursue"" people-smuggling gangs, Mrs May said.
The UK will pay Â£3.5m (five million euro) per year over two years towards the measures in the deal, and the Home Office said this was in addition to money previously pledged.
The six-page joint declaration says UK Border Force officers will continue visiting migrant camps to ""correct any misapprehensions"" about life in the UK and provide a ""more dissuasive and realistic sense of life for illegal migrants"" there.
Meanwhile, a demonstration by migrants - chanting ""we are not animals"" and ""open the borders"" - brought cars to a halt on a motorway and a road near the so-called ""Jungle"" camp.
BBC reporter Amanda Kirton said police were sent to the motorway which overlooks the camp to disperse the crowd, and tear gas was used.

579,"In 2012 those tensions erupted into deadly communal violence, and since then there have been sporadic clashes.
The state was again in the spotlight earlier this year when thousands of Rohingya were found stranded on boats in the Andaman Sea trying to leave Rakhine for Malaysia.
As Myanmar looks towards landmark national elections in November, the rising Buddhist nationalism in Rakhine has made it one of the more politically unpredictable regions.
The problems in Rakhine state stem from decades of armed violence, extreme poverty and underdevelopment.
Like other minorities, the Rakhine ethnic group face economic marginalisation and discrimination by the state.
The Rohingya, meanwhile - who make up a third of the population of Rakhine state - are denied full citizenship.
In Myanmar, they are widely referred to as Bengali - they are considered migrants from Bangladesh, though they have been in Myanmar for generations.
The United Nations describes them as a ""persecuted religious and linguistic minority"".
Tensions spilled over into inter-communal violence in 2012 around the state capital, Sittwe, sparked by the rape and murder of a Buddhist woman.
More than 200 people died and about 140,000 people - mainly Rohingya - were made homeless.
Many now live in camps with no or limited access to food, healthcare or education. Some Rohingya have turned to people smugglers to get them to Malaysia.
After Thailand and Malaysia increased scrutiny of areas where people smugglers operate in 2015, thousands of Rohingya were abandoned at sea by the traffickers.
This brought global attention to the Myanmar government's treatment of the Rohingya.
Earlier this year, the Rohingya were stripped of their right to vote or register as candidates for the elections.
The Arakan National Part (ANP), a party of ethnic Rakhine Buddhists which was formed last year, lobbied hard for that change.
Analysts say both national parties, the ruling Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) and the opposition National League for Democracy (NLD) face an uphill battle in the elections against the ANP in most of the state constituencies.
The NLD is viewed as sympathetic to the Rohingya - even though its leader Aung San Suu Kyi has steered clear of speaking out about the treatment of Rohingya.",Rakhine state on the western coast of Burma has seen long-running tension between the majority Buddhists and minority Muslims.,34536022

He is accused of falsely declaring under oath that he had never cheated at cricket in a 2012 libel case.
Justice Nigel Sweeney said on Friday he would accept a majority verdict.
Mr Cairns, who is one of New Zealand's greatest all-rounders and played 62 Tests from 1989 to 2004, is also accused of perverting the course of justice by inducing a fellow cricketer to give a false statement.
The jury of seven women and five men will resume their deliberations on Monday.
In the 2012 libel case - England's first Twitter libel trial - Mr Cairns won damages of $130,000 (£90,000) by successfully suing Indian Premier League chairman Lalit Modi over a 2010 tweet, which accused the cricketer of match-fixing while captain of the Chandigarh Lions in the now-defunct Indian Cricket League in 2008.
The prosecution at his current trial argued Mr Cairns had lied when he promised during the earlier trial that he had never cheated.
He is also accused of perverting the course of justice by inducing fellow New Zealand cricketer Lou Vincent to give a false witness statement in a Skype call.
Mr Vincent told the court that Mr Cairns had approached him to suggest he deliberately play badly for Chandigarh Lions and said he had helped to fix matches under ""direct orders"" from Mr Cairns, which the defendant denies.
The trial has also heard evidence from a host of cricketers including current New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum, former captain Daniel Vettori, former Australia captain Ricky Ponting, former New Zealand all-rounder Chris Harris and bowler Andre Adams.
During the case, Mr McCullum told the court Mr Cairns had approached him with a ""business proposition"" in a hotel room in Kolkata, India, in 2008, during the Indian Premier League, which involved match-fixing.

Ultimately, England failed to triumph on their own turf but that did not stop the tournament from being a magical experience for their players and fans, leaving a lingering feel-good factor that has been sorely lacking for them in most major finals since.
What made it so special, apart from the fact the sun was shining and England were winning, for a while at least?
""It was not only that we reached the semi-finals, it was that we had a lot of fun along the way, and I think the whole country did too,"" Alan Shearer told BBC Sport.
""It was great to be playing all our games at Wembley and the atmosphere kept getting better the further we went.""
There was something exceptional about that England side too. Shearer describes it as the best he played in during his eight-year international career and they had a team spirit to match.
Veteran commentator Barry Davies, who covered the tournament for the BBC, said: ""What started that off was a rather defensive siege mentality after a couple of off-field incidents and drinking sessions. They took a lot of stick from the press and I think that gave them a feeling of 'we will show you'.""

There were memorable lobbed goals by Davor Suker and Karel Poborsky, who helped make sure that surprise packages Croatia and the Czech Republic - who lost to Germany in the final - made a splash in their first appearances on this stage.

After a 0-0 draw with the Dutch and losing to THAT Paul Gascoigne goal for England, Craig Brown's side beat Switzerland 1-0 thanks to Ally McCoist's goal but but still finished third in Group A on goals scored, thanks to Patrick Kluivert's late consolation for the Netherlands in their 4-1 hammering by England.
But it was England who really got the party started.
Terry Venables' side began slowly with a stuttering 1-1 draw against Switzerland, notable only for Shearer's first international goal in 12 games. He ended up with five for the tournament, enough to win the golden boot as top scorer.
Things quickly got better for England. Lots better.
After Paul Gascoigne's spectacular solo strike - and 'dentist's chair' celebration - helped to sink Scotland 2-0, the Netherlands were demolished 4-1 in what was arguably England's best result at a major finals since they beat West Germany in the 1966 World Cup final.
The iconic imagery kept coming in the quarter-finals too. Yes, England had to scrap to earn a shoot-out win over Spain but there was the sight of Stuart Pearce's fist-pumping celebration after despatching his penalty that helped send them through.
Then came the semi-finals, Germany and the end of the dream - but only after a truly epic encounter.
Davies, who was at Wembley commentating, said: ""That was particularly special.
""If somebody told me you are going up to heaven and you can take one game with you, I think I would take that England game. I'd try to get the result changed when I got up there, though.
""It was a night where a lot of the things I believed in about commentary worked. If you go back to the original recording it was six or seven minutes before kick-off when Des Lynam handed over to me from the studio.
""I didn't really say very much in that time because the crowd were singing constantly. I just dotted a few I's and crossed a few T's. It was a huge atmosphere and of course England were incredibly unlucky in the end.""
A Shearer header gave England the lead after three minutes but Germany quickly levelled through Stefan Kuntz and, try as they might, England could not find a winner.
Teddy Sheringham had a shot cleared off the line, Shearer sent another header wide and Darren Anderton hit the post in extra-time but the chance you will probably remember best of all came when Gascoigne lunged to try to turn in Shearer's cross, but missed it by a matter of millimetres.
""When I was doing England matches, there were two goals which weren't scored, which should have been,"" Davies added.
""The first was Gary Lineker versus Argentina at the 1986 World Cup which would have made it 2-2 in the quarter-finals. It was one of those 'oh no' moments, not that I said it in the commentary, but I thought it to myself.
""It was the same with Gascoigne when the ball rolled across the box in extra-time. By then the game had become almost unreal. It was golden goal then, so it would have won it.""
It was left to penalties to decide the winner, and an all too familiar ending from England's point of view.
Shearer, David Platt, Pearce (again), Gascoigne and Sheringham were successful from the spot but Germany also scored with their first five efforts.
That meant sudden death and, after Gareth Southgate's tame effort was saved by Andreas Kopke, Andreas Muller stepped up to fire Germany into the final.
""It was such an exciting match and it had such a sad conclusion,"" added Davies, who has covered 10 World Cups, seven European Championships, and countless England internationals during a broadcasting career that will also take in the hockey tournament at this summer's Olympics.
""I can honestly say that when Gareth walked up to take his penalty I did not fancy him at all. There was something wrong with his body language and you just get a feeling. It was horrible to lose like that, after coming all that way.""

Dennis Pursley quit after GB fell short of its target of six Olympic medals in the pool, collecting just three.
""It would be nice to have someone British who knows the coaches,"" said double gold medallist Adlington.
""It takes time to get to know everyone and how they work. If you get someone British, they know how to start their job straight away.""
British Swimming is currently undertaking a review of the sport following GB's disappointing Olympic campaign.
The findings of the panel, which includes Bob Bowman, the coach of Olympic swimming legend Michael Phelps, are due later this month and an announcement about Pursley's successor is expected soon after.
Adlington, Britain's most-successful Olympic swimmer, has admitted her future in the sport depends on Bill Furniss - linked as a possible replacement for Pursley - remaining as her coach.
""If I was going to carry on, I would only want to be coached by Bill,"" said Adlington.
""We need to sit down and see whether he thinks I have more in me and what he wants to do as a coach.""
Adlington, who won two golds at the 2008 Olympics and then a pair of bronze medals in London, is unlikely to compete at the 2016 Games as she feels she will be too old for her favoured 800m event.
""Rio is probably a little bit out of reach,"" she said. ""I will be 27 and I do think that for a female distance swimmer it is difficult.
""If I was a sprinter, I would never even question it and would be back in the water already, but it's just whether I can move down to the 200m and 400m. Bill is the only one who can really answer that for me. To be honest, after all of these years, he knows me better than I know myself.""

""Every athlete wants to be there and I would love to be there myself, but we'll have to see.""
Adlington is about to undertake one of the biggest challenges of her career by cycling 280 miles across Zambia. The Bike for Africa project is hoping to raise £50,000 for Sport in Action.
She is due to return in the middle of October and will spend the following few weeks consulting with Furniss and national performance director Michael Scott before deciding whether to carry on competing.

Conflict, rebellion and murder - discover more about Richard III's life
Richard III died at the battle of Bosworth in 1485 while fighting a rebellion by the future Henry VII.
He was buried in the church of the Greyfriars in Leicester but the precise location was lost when the building was demolished.
Working with Philippa Langley, of the Richard III Society, a University of Leicester team uncovered a skeleton in September 2012 and its identity was confirmed earlier this month.
Despite a number of rival claims, Leicester Cathedral is preparing to take possession of the remains by summer 2014 at the latest.
A spokesman for the Richard III Society said: ""The tomb design was commissioned by Philippa Langley in September 2010 at the very beginning of the Looking For Richard project.
""It is based on Richard's life, and what was important and meaningful to him, and the design was undertaken by a team of specialists with over 40 years of research into Richard III.
""The society is looking forward to working with the cathedral and Leicester City Council to honour the return of the king.""
The society said it expected to meet the estimated Â£30,000 cost through donations.
Liz Hudson, from Leicester Cathedral, said officials would brief architects about its requirements for the tomb on 12 March, with final proposals expected in the summer.
She said: ""There is an agreed process to make this decision and it will ensure all views are heard and considered. No proposals will be considered outside of this process.
""This process will give us a design that will be appropriate for a working, public, worshipping cathedral and for all those who come in future generations to visit King Richard's final resting place.""

Mr Jones said: ""I fully understand. I told the prime minister he has my total support. I am not unhappy. It is right he should refresh his team.""
His deputy, Preseli Pembrokeshire MP Stephen Crabb, is expected to replace him.
Mr Jones said anyone appointed to the cabinet knew that one day they would have this sort of conversation with the prime minister.
By David CornockBBC Wales Parliamentary correspondent
David Jones was as cheerful as anyone who had just been sacked could be...
He said he expected the reshuffle to be bigger than anticipated with a lot of departures from government.
The leader of the Welsh Conservatives, Andrew RT Davies, has declined to comment on the departure until a replacement has been officially announced.
Mr Jones succeeded his former Wales Office boss, Cheryl Gillan, in September 2012, and was the 16th secretary of state and the first to have been an AM, having sat in the Welsh assembly from 2002 to 2003.
A Welsh speaker, who lives with his family in Rhos-on-Sea, Mr Jones has always described himself as a ""proud Welshman"".
Analysis by BBC political correspondent Dan Davies
Shortly after he was appointed as Welsh Secretary, David Jones said the UK and Welsh governments had to work together for the good of Wales.
Did he achieve that ambition?
Whether you blame him or not, the two administrations have had a combustible relationship of late.
There have been furious rows about the state of public services, in particular the NHS.
They have been to the Supreme Court to sort out legal disagreements about the extent of the Welsh assembly's law-making powers.
And there is a bitter and ongoing disagreement about who will pay to upgrade south Wales' railway lines.
Such rows are probably not what David Jones had in mind when he delivered his mission statement about setting aside political differences.
Born in London to Welsh parents in 1952, Mr Jones has lived in north Wales most of his life.
He studied law and as a solicitor worked alongside Ieuan Wyn Jones, who went on to become Plaid Cymru's leader and the deputy first minister.
David Jones became a Conservative Welsh AM in 2002, filling a seat vacated by Rod Richards. He stood down at the following year's elections.
In 2005, he was elected as the MP for Clwyd West. He was a shadow minister for Wales and then a junior minister at the Wales Office, before succeeding Cheryl Gillan as Secretary of State in September 2012.

585,"Fifty-seven refugees, including 14 families and 20 children, arrived in Belfast on Thursday morning.
The families will spend five days in a special welcome centre before moving into their new homes.
The first group of Syrian refugees arrived in Northern Ireland in December 2015.
The new arrivals range in age from two years old to their late 50s, and several of the adults are believed to have university-level education.
The Department of Social Development (DSD) has direct responsibility for overseeing the operation of bringing the refugees into Northern Ireland.
One of the families will be housed in Belfast, while the remainder will be resettled in Londonderry.
Senior church leaders in Derry have said the arrival of the refugees is an opportunity for compassion.
""I think we've really all been moved by the terrible destruction that's gone on in Syria and in the wider Middle East region,"" said Bishop of Derry Donal McKeown.
""I think it's in the heart of the Derry people to be generous and to be welcoming. I don't doubt they'll be made very welcome here in the city and will enrich the educational experience of the children that we have here.""
Church of Ireland Bishop for Derry and Raphoe Ken Good said people will want to make a difference.
""These lives have been thrown upside down, the catastrophe that has befallen so many of these families,"" he said.
""My vision is to look in 20 years time or so and that these children will say to us:  'We are so thankful that this city was the place we were sent, that this city welcomed us as they did, that this city turned our lives around and gave us a fresh start'.""
The families will each be helped to find a home, a job and school places for their children.
The refugees are expected to live in Northern Ireland for five years, after which time they can choose whether to go back to Syria or apply for UK citizenship as long as they do not have a criminal record.
The families will be able to move freely across the UK, but will not be able to travel to the Republic of Ireland as laws regarding refugees in both jurisdictions are different.

591,"The program - Moments - was released in some countries in 2015, but withheld elsewhere because of local data privacy rules.
The company has created a different version of the software to get around these restrictions.
But it acknowledged the new edition required ""a little bit of work"" for users to get the most out of it.
Moment's core features are that it automatically groups together photos featuring the same friend or friends, and then makes it easy to share the pictures with them if they have installed the same app.
In the original version, the snaps are automatically tagged with people's names, because Facebook is able to match them to other photos in its wider database.
But data protection watchdogs in the EU and Canada had expressed concern their citizens would have no way to opt out of the process.
To address this, the adapted app now links together photos of similar-looking faces but requires the user to identify who they are.
Moments is not the only app to use facial recognition to sort images.
Google Photos is the most popular alternative to do so.
But the search giant has yet to extend the facility to Europe, to avoid falling foul of the Irish Data Protection Commissioner.
Facebook has not disclosed how many people have signed up to Moments since its release on the US's iOS and Android stores 11 months ago.
However, the company has said more than 600 million pictures have been shared via the app so far.
""Our primary purpose is to solve a problem that we know that people have, where they never get the photos that their friends take of them,"" the app's product manager Will Ruben told the BBC.
""We view that as a pretty different type of sharing than might happen on Facebook, where people share photos more broadly with a large group of friends or even publicly.
""Moments is closer to the type of sharing that might happen these days on Whatsapp or other [private] messaging apps - but it places the photos together into a collection.""
Users decide which photos are shared with the people labelled in them, and can withdraw access at a later point.
They can also use the app to turn selected photos into slideshows that can be shared to their Facebook wall and elsewhere.
The technique - which Facebook refers to as ""facial clustering"" - still relies on some processing being done beyond the user's handset, but Facebook said it had taken great lengths to comply with the EU and Canada's privacy rules.
""A cropped low-resolution of the photo is uploaded [to the cloud] so that your phone gets a numerical representation of that face,"" Mr Ruben said.
""But that number is not stored anywhere on our servers, and it is only used to compare against the other photos on your phone.
""No comparison is being done on the server.""
Copies of the images are, however, stored at Facebook's data centres as soon as they are shared with someone else.
""Facebook has notified this office of the Moments app and advised us that within the EU version of the Moments app they do not control or initiate the use of any feature recognition technology,"" said a spokeswoman for the Irish Data Protection Commissioner.
""Consideration of this development is ongoing and we will more closely look at the technical details of the app following its release.""
Mr Ruben said Facebook believed the original version of Moments remained the ""best version"" but the new edition was still ""easy to use.
""You don't need to label all the faces on your phone,"" he said.
""The idea is to share with the people closest to you, so usually it's just the top 10 people or so.""
One industry-watcher said the lack of auto-tagging might slow the app's adoption.
""Any additional effort that people have to put into a service creates a barrier,"" said Ben Wood, from the tech consultancy CCS Insight.
""The seamless experience in other markets is therefore more compelling.
""However, once people invest a little time, they will see the benefits, and it could catch on, on that basis.""
Facebook's use of facial recognition has, however, caused controversy in the US.
Last week, a US judge refused to block a class action case in which it is claimed the technology violates Illinois's Biometric Privacy Act.

Suddenly it's difficult to find anyone who has anything good to say about it at all.
But the recently installed Chancellor of the University of Birmingham Lord Karan Bilimoria says there is such a thing as ""good immigration"".

He said David Cameron had made a ""big mistake"" by promising ""unattainable"" targets from which the home secretary now admits the government has been ""blown off course"".
In his hard-hitting interview, Lord Bilimoria said: ""The number of international students to Britain fell for the first time last year. And the number from India have collapsed by over 20%.
""Why? Because the government has an immigration policy that is sending out very damaging signals.
""I challenge the Home Secretary Theresa May to say how many illegal immigrants are there. She hasn't a clue because they've lost control of illegal immigration.""
Instead, he said there should be new targets to increase the numbers of international students. France plans to double its number of students from India by 2020.
The University of Birmingham is one of two members of the elite Russell Group of research-led universities here in the Midlands.
The other, Warwick, says its 5,000-plus international students bring in fees totalling nearly Â£90m, which is then reinvested to the benefit of British students.
""The government may say Britain is open for business but they're sending out a message that's not so welcoming,"" Warwick said.

Her story was told by newspapers after her mother turned to journalists to expose the scandal of a failing care system in the former South Glamorgan County Council area.
She had asked a simple question - how could her daughter go into care for her protection and end up being at even more risk?
What followed were calls for change, investigations and the publication of the Sarah Report. Lessons had to be learned about how councils treated vulnerable children in the care system, it said.
Over the ensuing 23 years I had often wondered about what happened to Sarah.
Whenever the issue of child sexual exploitation came up I wondered where she ended up. Did Sarah survive the system? She would be 35 now. How would she reflect on that time; a time when the adults who were meant to be protecting her had failed?
Back then, BBC Wales' Week In Week Out made several programmes on the issue but we never met Sarah because she had been moved again - to yet another unsuitable foster placement then another children's home and then, eventually, to a secure unit.
While making this week's Week In Week Out programme about a mother who feared for her daughter's safety in care, we decided to look for Sarah.
We wanted to know what would have made a difference to her back then and what would have stopped her running away, using drugs and taking such serious risks.
Sarah was not her real name - it was one she had chosen for anonymity in the 1990s. After all she was talking about things no girl of 12 should have to talk about, let alone be living.
After weeks of searching I got a breakthrough and finally found Sarah. I made contact, hoping she would not be scared or angry about a journalist contacting her after all these years.
What I found was an anxious woman who asked a lot of questions. Why were we making the programme? What did we know about care?
When I explained another mother had asked us the same question her mother asked journalists all those years ago, she agreed to meet.
""If you think it might help the girl who's in care now then I will talk to you,"" she said.
""I tried to help then, but if kids are still going through the same stuff in 2017 then something has gone wrong hasn't it?""
We arranged to meet. She gave me an address but explained she did not exactly have a home.
I was not sure what Sarah would be like now. I hoped that after being the subject of a high profile report which highlighted shortcomings, she would have spent the years that followed getting all the right help. She may have a house full of kids, a career.
I kept thinking ""please let her be happy and sorted"".
When she opened the front door I was shocked.
Sarah's face told her story. She looks older than her years. She looks ill.
""That's what being a crack addict does for you,"" she told me. ""I was bigger than this when I came out of prison a few years ago.""
She is now frail and has been warned that unless she stops using drugs she will die. But Sarah says the drugs are what help her to live with her past.
She agreed to be interviewed for the programme; for her it felt like the right thing. She wants so much to help children who are still in the system and who perhaps, like her, are angry, confused, feeling insecure about being in care.
All the things she felt back then.
She was angry to hear that one in 10 children in care in Wales last year experienced three or more placement moves.
""Now it makes me angry, makes me sick to my stomach to think there's kids out there now going through the same things I was going through,"" she said.
Just like Sarah, this young girl needed help to deal with her escalating behaviour.
She went into care because her mum could not cope with her refusing to go to school, getting into trouble with the police and sniffing lighter fuel.
But as soon as she was placed with foster carers she ran away, always back to her mum's house and the streets where she grew up, until another girl from care led her to the Riverside area of Cardiff where, back then, there was an established red light district.
Sarah showed us where she was taught to sell sex at the age of 12. She was matter of fact - there were no tears.
She said:  ""I was like 12, she was 15, 16 and this guy pulled over and he was like 'oh I will give you Â£40' and my friend passed me a condom and he gave me the money I thought do you know what, that's the easiest money I have ever made in my life and that's how I was into it.
""That money would buy me what I wanted, fags, drugs, whatever I wanted.""
To the men who abused Sarah, her age and the fact that she was a sad, angry, confused child did not matter.
""A few guys did know my real age and they still had sex with me,"" she said.
""I used to get into the car and shake and think 'oh my God, he's going to take me away he's going to kill me he's going to dump me somewhere'.
""And I used to take drugs and alcohol to build confidence to get in that car and stuff - without that I wouldn't be able to do it.
""I didn't know about the dangers, or the sexually transmitted diseases or that I could be raped.""
Sarah said one day she was picked up off the streets and attacked.
In a calm and matter of fact way, as we drove around the area where she used to wait for her abusers, she told us: ""I was gang raped when I was 13 - the guy gave me a load of tablets - yeah, that was really bad that was.""
I asked if she reported it to the police. She had not. She went back to the foster carer's home and said nothing.
Sarah did not think anyone would listen back then.
""You just put it to the back of your mind and move on,"" she said. ""I was very angry person, for a long time. I can't get in relationships and stuff like that because I can't trust no-one and when a man touches me it makes me cringe.""
We asked Sarah what would have made a difference to her back then. What would have stopped her running away, being drawn into that world of sexual exploitation and violence?
""Maybe if they had a foster family who did care about me and really did help me,"" she said.
'Turns my stomach'
Cardiff council - not involved with the recent case examined by BBC Wales - told us it was committed to doing everything possible to prevent child sexual exploitation.
It said it would be inappropriate for it to comment on the working practices of its predecessor - South Glamorgan council.
But, a spokesman added, important lessons had been learned following the Sarah Report which helped bring about marked improvements in the way local authorities look after vulnerable children.
Having met Sarah, it seemed some things had not changed for her, but if she could talk to the girl whose mum is worrying about her right now because she is in the system?
""Go to school, not to smoke cannabis, don't have sex with loads of men, just be that like that age you are supposed to be. Get her GCSEs, get a job make something of your life.
""It turns my stomach to think she could end up like me. It does make me feel physically sick, like. They need to do what they can to help her so she don't turn out like me.""
Sarah is trying to build a new life and wants a future, but she is not sure if that will ever be possible.

599,"Wireless Infrastructure Group (WIG) has agreed to take on board a new shareholder.
Venture capital firm 3i Infrastructure has committed £75m to take a 25% stake in the Bellshill-based firm.
The company builds and operates telecom masts in suburban and rural areas.
Being independent of the major mobile phone operators, it provides capacity which they can pay to share.
Earlier this year, Bellshill-based WIG announced plans to invest £1bn in new UK infrastructure.
That is to be focussed on new, mainly rural locations for masts, as the telecoms regulator requires providers to reduce the 'not-spots' in coverage.
The expansion includes installation of small cells and fibre-optic wiring to boost mobile connections in big buildings and on city streets.
The company also plans to expand in meeting mobile communications demand from rail passengers.
WIG was founded 10 years ago, and now operates 2,000 masts. It has expanded into Ireland and the Netherlands, and plans to expand further into western Europe.
The investment by 3i Infrastructure adds to the shareholding by US-based Wood Creek Capital Management, and the Lanarkshire management team.
Scott Coates, chief executive of WIG, said: ""Bringing an established European infrastructure investor on board, alongside our existing North American partner, provides us with the financial capabilities needed to scale up our business through investment in up to £1bn of new infrastructure.
""This will transform our ability to support our customers as they extend network coverage in rural areas and improve capacity in urban centres.
""Independent infrastructure companies like WIG provide a conduit for long term infrastructure investors to support the telecoms industry as it takes on the challenges of expanding the quality and reach of connectivity.""",A Lanarkshire mobile telecom firm has secured new investment which values the whole company at £300m and opens up funding for a major expansion plan.,35989198

The Blues went ahead early on when Diego Costa capitalised on Kyle McFadzean's mistake to set up Oscar but the hosts equalised through Darren Potter's deflected strike.
Oscar finished sublimely twice, before Eden Hazard scored his first Chelsea goal of the season from the spot after Potter fouled him.
Bertrand Traore slotted home his first Chelsea goal from Hazard's cross to wrap up proceedings.
Victory over a side 20th in the Championship leaves Chelsea boss Guus Hiddink, winner of the FA Cup with the Blues in 2009, still undefeated in eight games since replacing Jose Mourinho at Stamford Bridge.
Their reward for Sunday's FA Cup success was a home tie against Manchester City in the fifth round.
""It's already a final now. It's a huge game,"" Hiddink said.
Media playback is not supported on this device
Hiddink chose to give Belgium international Hazard, who has recovered from a groin injury, his first start since 3 January, hoping last season's Premier League player of the year would end a run of 28 games without a goal.
Hazard linked well with left-back Baba Rahman throughout - causing Jordan Spence no end of problems - but it looked like that goalless streak would continue when Dons goalkeeper David Martin somehow kept him out when one-on-one in the first half.
However, in the second half, Hazard drew a foul in the box from Potter and calmly placed the ball the other side of Martin.
Asked why Hazard instead of Oscar took the penalty, Hiddink said: ""They decided themselves because we have this hierarchy of the penalties. Oscar gave it to Eden as everyone knows he has not scored for a long time.""
Hazard, 25, then chased down a long ball up field to lay the ball into the path of Traore to strike home before being replaced by Pedro shortly afterwards for a morale boosting performance.
Chelsea named a strong side, with only Ruben Loftus-Cheek not a Premier League regular, but the Blues were wasteful in front of goal against a side struggling in the Championship, having 15 efforts in the first half.
A tame Diego Costa effort was foiled by Martin early on and Oscar missed two decent opportunities before scoring his first - a tap in after Costa's persistence.
Martin, whose defence struggled to cope with the sheer pace of Chelsea's attacks, pulled off a fine save when Oscar played into an unmarked Diego Costa on the edge of the six yard box but his effort was tame.
After Potter's strike looped off Matic and over Courtois, Costa missed with the goal gaping from a ball into the middle.
But Oscar finally had his side in front again when Loftus-Cheek's past split the defence and the Brazilian finished with aplomb before making it 3-1 before the break with a strike from outside the box.
Karl Robinson's side are the lowest-scorers in the Championship and were dealt a blow before kick off as Nicky Maynard was only fit enough for the bench.
With Dean Bowditch ploughing a very lonely furrow up front on his own, the hosts were restricted mostly to long shots, with on-loan Bolton winger Rob Hall seeing an effort tipped over the bar.
Substitute Daniel Powell jinked his way through the Premier League's side defence but his strike, saved by the feet of Courtois, was the closest the hosts came to a second.
""This was a free game for us but I'm disappointed as well, I thought we were poor,"" Robinson told BBC Sport.
""We almost caused our own problems at times in the game.""
Chelsea boss Hiddink revelled in his side's victory and Oscar's hat-trick performance.
""We are delighted,"" said the Blues' interim manager. ""The concentration against the big teams is always high but these games you have to be well prepared mentally. They got even but we reacted very well.""
""Oscar is playing with a smile on his face and that's what I like with the players when they know their obligations and they do it.""

Jenny Foote, 38, had interrupted the programme he was watching to make the request on behalf of another resident.
Meanza, 47, admitted manslaughter but was found guilty of murder.
He has been ordered to serve a minimum of 24 years in prison.
Sentencing him, Judge John Bevan QC told the Old Bailey any parole board would need to think ""long and hard"" before considering him for release as he posed an ""ongoing danger.""
Prosecutor Brian O'Neill QC told jurors even though Meanza had been the subject of a hospital order since the 1990s, he should not escape responsibility for his actions.
He said: ""It cannot be right either as a matter of law or on the grounds of public policy that Michael Meanza - or any defendant - should be able to escape full responsibility for an unlawful killing on the basis he is too angry an individual to be guilty of murder.""
When asked if he had any regrets, Meanza told the court he had some but they were too few to list.
The court was told Ms Foote discussed the noise level of his TV from the doorway of his room and then returned to her office.
Three hours later he killed her in a ""ferocious and brutal attack"", the court heard.

Sahin was jailed for 22 years and Ozmen for 20 years.
It was the largest-ever seizure in the UK, worth £512m.
At the High Court in Glasgow, judge Lord Kinclaven told Sahin: ""Your role was a significant one, you were the master of the MV Hamal.

Prosecutors said that the boat travelled from Istanbul via Tenerife to South America then on to the North Sea.
The raid happened after the MV Hamal was halted in international waters and brought back to Aberdeen Harbour.
It was intercepted by the Royal Navy warship HMS Somerset and Border Force officials.
Sahin was the captain of the boat. Ozmen second in command. They were first offenders.
Senior investigating officer from the National Crime Agency, John McGowan, said: ""The court has clearly stated that you don't have to be a kingpin of an international drug smuggling operation to incur the wrath of the court.

611,"Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said the ""truly momentous"" decision would support trade and create jobs.
Gatwick airport said it was disappointed with the decision, which was ""not the right answer for Britain"".
The issue has split the Cabinet, with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson saying a third runway was ""undeliverable"".
The Education Secretary, Justine Greening, whose Putney constituency in southwest London is near the airport, has also been a vocal critic of Heathrow expansion.
The Department for Transport said a new runway at Heathrow would bring economic benefits to passengers and the wider economy worth up to £61bn and create as many as 77,000 additional local jobs over the next 14 years.
Heathrow said the expansion would allow it to offer more direct flights to UK destinations as well as up to 40 new cities abroad such as Wuhan, Osaka and Quito.

Death sentence for Heathrow villages
A public consultation will now be held on the effects of airport expansion before the government makes a final decision as part of a national policy statement on aviation.
MPs will then vote on that decision in the winter of 2017-18.  It is unlikely that any new runway capacity would be operational before 2025.
Construction is not likely to begin until 2020 or 2021, the Airports Commission has said.
Mr Johnson, the MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip in west London, doubted whether construction would ever start: ""The day when the bulldozers appear is a long way off, if indeed they ever materialise.""
Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, also said expanding the west London airport was the wrong decision for both London and the UK.
""There are more people affected by noise because of Heathrow than people affected by the airports in Paris, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Munich and Madrid combined,"" he said. ""The air in London is a killer. It makes you sick and it's unlawful.""
Greenpeace UK chief John Sauven said a third runway at Heathrow would increase air pollution and ""be a waste of time, money and lives"".
Andy Slaughter, Labour MP for Hammersmith, said opposition from predominantly Tory-controlled councils, communities and MPs meant ""the chances of a toxic third runway being built are vanishingly small"".
However, a wide range of unions and business groups welcomed the decision to expand Heathrow. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said it was ""absolutely vital for Britain"", while CBI chief Paul Drechsler said it would create jobs and boost economic growth.
Heathrow management said the airport was ready to deliver a third runway that was ""fair, affordable and secures the benefits of expansion for the whole of the UK"".
Expanding airport capacity in the South East of England has been a political hot potato for many years, which is why successive governments have attempted to duck the issue.
Although Heathrow has always been the favourite among businesses, it has attracted the most opposition from MPs with constituencies near the airport or under flight paths.
A study last year led by Sir Howard Davies recommended a third runway at Heathrow, but other options included a new runway at Gatwick or extending one of Heathrow's existing runways.
Zac Goldsmith, the Tory MP for Richmond Park, has resigned in protest against the decision, which he called ""catastrophic"".
The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, whose Hayes and Harlington constituency includes Heathrow, said the announcement was the start, rather than the end, of the process.
""It beggars belief that it has taken ministers over a year since the publication of the Davies report to even make that start,"" he said. ""There is no justification for dithering on this scale.""
We have a long way to go before we see the proverbial shovels in the ground - there will be legal and planning challenges aplenty to come. However, with today's decision to recommend a third runway, this government has arrived at a point its predecessors failed to, with a real prospect of action. From beating ourselves up for not being able to build anything, the UK is suddenly building everything.
Heathrow was chosen because of the extra boost it gives to the UK economy, but it is not the only mammoth project out there. After a last-minute wobble, the £18bn Hinkley Point nuclear power station was given the green light, while the biggest project of them all is coming down the track fast.
Construction on the £42bn HS2 is scheduled to begin next year - and that is probably not all. Chancellor Philip Hammond has hinted he may reveal some moderate borrowing to fund targeted infrastructure spending in his Autumn Statement next month. It's enough to make the Victorians sit up and take notice.
If projections for a fairly sharp post-Brexit slowdown in the economy next year are correct then we may need this spending boost. If these projects proceed on time, there is something else we will need: people to build all this stuff. With unemployment close to historic lows, it's not clear we have enough. Like the Victorians did, it seems very likely we will need to look abroad to find the workers for our golden age of infrastructure - and that, post-Brexit, will present a political rather than an engineering challenge.
Willie Walsh, chief executive of British Airways owner IAG, welcomed the decision to expand Heathrow but added: ""The government's directive to cap customer charges at today's level is fundamental. Heathrow is the world's most expensive hub airport so it's critical that new capacity is affordable.""
His counterpart at Virgin Atlantic, Craig Kreeger, described the announcement as an exciting opportunity to radically transform airline competition at the UK's main airport"".

The fault was highlighted by gadget sites which said it was caused by a manufacturing issue that meant some screen controller chips became loose.
Apple was criticised by one expert who said it was the phonemaker's responsibility to fix it.
Apple is charging $149 in the USA for the service that will only be available on phones that are ""in working order"".
In a statement on its website, Apple said it had ""determined"" that displays on some iPhone 6 Plus handsets flickered or became unresponsive if the device was dropped several times on a hard surface and was then subjected to ""further stress"".
An iPhone 6 Plus suffering this problem, which worked and did not have a cracked or broken screen, was eligible for the repair programme, it said.
The service is available worldwide and costs Â£146.44 in the UK.
Apple said that customers who had already paid to get their phone cured of ""touch disease"" should get in touch to be repaid for the amount they spent beyond the programme fee.
The repair programme will run for five years beyond the initial date on which the iPhone 6 Plus went on sale, said Apple.
Stuart Miles, founder of gadget news site Pocket-lint, said: ""I think if it's a known defect that isn't caused by the user then it should be the responsibility of Apple to fix the phone free of charge regardless of the age.""
The manufacturing problem with the iPhone 6 Plus was first highlighted by gadget site iFixit which said it had seen an ""influx of faulty iPhones"".
In a blogpost about the problem posted in August, iFixit said there were ""pages and pages"" of messages from aggrieved iPhone 6 Plus owners on the Apple support site complaining about the fault.

Speaking to party activists in Glasgow, Ms Dugdale proposed using the new powers to help groups including carers and new mothers from poor backgrounds.
The Scottish government will outline its proposals for welfare on Tuesday.
In her speech, Ms Dugdale set out key changes she plans to make to the welfare system, and stated that Scotland ""can and must"" do things differently to the Conservative government at Westminster.
A range of benefits including the Carer's Allowance, benefits for people with disabilities like the Disability Living Allowance, Personal Independence Payment and Attendance Allowance, and other benefits which are targeted at low-income households such as maternity grants and funeral payments will be devolved in the Scotland Bill.
Ms Dugdale said: ""Unlike any previous election, it will not be the constitution which is the centre of this Scottish election but rather how we use our powers. 2016 will be the first Scottish tax and spend election.
""Scottish Labour will never look for an excuse not to act. We will use the new powers we hold and grasp with both hands the possibilities they provide.""
Her proposals included:
She said that raising the level of Carer's Allowance to match the level of Jobseeker's Allowance would be worth about £600 a year extra to carers, which would ""help to tackle poverty amongst a group in society who give so much to others.""
Ms Dugdale also said that the Sure Start maternity grant has been set at £500 for 14 years, while the cost of having a baby has increased.
""We would bring it more up to date by more than doubling it to £1,030, helping families with the average cost of a cot, buggy, car seat and nappies for a year"", she will pledge.
The Scottish government said at the weekend that it wanted to reduce the stress of applying for benefits when new welfare powers are devolved.
Social Justice Secretary Alex Neil also said SNP ministers would be looking to remove the stigma that can be attached to claiming social security.
Just over 15% of welfare spending north of the border will be devolved, the Scottish government has said, with the legislation also giving the parliament in Edinburgh the power to create new benefits and top up existing payments.
Mr Neil will use a debate on Tuesday to set out the key principles that he argues will underpin the Scottish government approach to welfare - that social security is an investment in the people of Scotland, with respect for the individual at the heart of the system.
Also at the weekend, Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie told his party's spring conference that he would put forward a ""big, bold agenda"" for change in the run-up to the election on 5 May.
He pledged the party's policies - including plans to raise £475m for education by increasing the income tax rate in Scotland by 1p - would make the country ""fit for the future"".
Changes to drug policy which aim to treat addiction as a health issue rather than a criminal justice problem will also be included in its manifesto, along with plans to put the treatment of mental health problems on an equal standing in law with physical ill health.
The Lib Dems also want more NHS funds to go to GPs in a bid to address recruitment issues, and say councils should have the power to set local taxation.
Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said the new devolved powers would allow the Scottish government to make ""real choices"" about the level of benefits in Scotland.
She added: ""We are glad to see Labour finally catching up with my call last year for an increase in the Carers' Allowance - which we believe is the right thing to do.
""However, all political parties need to be sure there is a fair balance between helping people who need our support, as well as the taxpayers who fund it.
""That means that when these new welfare powers are devolved, we will press the SNP to support a welfare system that provides a safety net, but one which also helps people back into work - which will always be the best route out of poverty.""","The Scottish Parliament vote in May will be Scotland's first ""tax and spend"" election, Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale has argued.",35686204

Founder Richard Davies said the initiative was about ""convenience"".
""It enables people to drop off and pick up tickets in their own time and in a secure way at locations at the heart of many UK cities, and close to most venues,"" he said.
Davies launched Twickets in 2011, after he saw a fan offering to give away tickets to a show for free on Twitter instead of letting them go to waste.
The London-based web designer believed many other people would rather sell tickets to music, sport or theatre events at cost price, or less, to real fans, rather than cash in and sell them at a profit through secondary ticket websites like Seatwave and Viagogo.
His service began as a Twitter account, putting buyers and sellers in touch with one another. But it grew quickly, launching an app in 2013, and attracting the attention of artists like One Direction and Adele - both of whom have encouraged fans to use the service.
The site is currently selling tickets to the V Festival, and Morrissey's Manchester show, both taking place this weekend, this year for less than face value.
One Direction even sold 6,000 tickets for their On The Road Again tour directly through the site - although it is worth noting that Twicket's backers include artist management company Modest, whose clients include One Direction.
Twickets adds a 10% fee to every sale. ""Drop and collect"" tickets will attract a further Â£2.50 handling charge per transaction.
Specialist music retailer Fopp, which is part of the HMV Retail group, currently has nine branches across the UK.

But Vettel is kidding no-one, least of all Mercedes.

""We didn't see it in pre-season testing or at the first race,"" says Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff.
""But since then every race has been a step forward from Ferrari. Their rate of development has been very impressive over the winter and the last three races. That is quite a challenge for us.""
It is a remarkable turnaround, coming as it does after 2014, when the Italian team had their worst season in 21 years, scoring only two podiums.
And while Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton has a relatively comfortable 27-point advantage at the head of the championship after an almost perfect start to the season, Vettel is just one point behind the Englishman's team-mate Nico Rosberg.
So how have Ferrari gone from also-rans to title contenders in the space of a few months?
Last year, Ferrari's performance was so bad that Fernando Alonso finally ran out of patience after five years of battling against the odds and decided that, to get a title-winning car in the relatively near future, he had to go elsewhere, even if it meant taking a temporary step backwards.
In hindsight, Alonso's decision was clearly a mistake. But it's not hard to see where the Spaniard, now at struggling McLaren-Honda, was coming from.
Alonso came agonisingly close to winning the title with Ferrari in both 2010 and 2012, despite an inferior car to eventual champion Vettel's Red Bull. He won at least one race in each of his first four seasons at Maranello and finished second in the championship three times in his first four years.
In 2014, Alonso managed just two podium finishes - a third place in China and a second in the wet/dry race in Hungary. He finished sixth in the championship.
Through that season, Ferrari's average lap-time deficit to the fastest Mercedes car in qualifying was 1.22 seconds.
The power-unit - which was about 50bhp off the Mercedes and had an under-effective and inefficient hybrid system that was a particular handicap in races - accounted for about two-thirds of that, with the remaining 0.4secs due to the chassis, which is predominantly to do with aerodynamics.
This year, Ferrari's average qualifying deficit to the fastest Mercedes is 0.705secs, but in the races it is nowhere near that. Indeed, it has been as good as negligible in two of the four races this year.
Much of the progress is down to the engine - Ferrari have added 65bhp to their V6 turbo hybrid already, with more to come. Mercedes - despite suggestions last year of an extra 50bhp for 2015 - have found more like only 15-20bhp at best.
Judging by the speed-trap figures, Mercedes probably retain a small power advantage. But only very small.
To all intents and purposes, then, any difference in lap time between the Ferrari and the Mercedes is probably down to the chassis, the driver and the difference in the two cars' behaviour on the tyres. They are close enough that, if Ferrari get everything right, Mercedes are beatable.
Tyres are a key factor here. The Ferrari is more gentle on its tyres, a characteristic it has retained for many years.
This gives it an advantage in races, in that it can run for longer at closer to its maximum potential. But it is a disadvantage in qualifying, as it is harder to get the tyres up to full working temperature before the start of a lap.
That means the Ferraris, for now, are qualifying behind at least one of the Mercedes. Which makes their races more difficult because, with delicate tyres making it hard to follow another car closely, track position is a critical advantage.
Analysing the two teams' comparative performance in qualifying last year and this is not quite a like-for-like comparison.
Last year, Rosberg out-qualified Hamilton 11 times to seven, so more often than not the fastest Mercedes was the German's.
This year, Hamilton has upped his game and has scored four poles out of four. And Ferrari's average qualifying deficit to Rosberg is only 0.214secs.
Taking the Briton out of the race results also makes interesting reading.
Rosberg has two second and two third places so far this season, which is an average position of 2.5. But the average of the best result of the Ferrari drivers at each race is slightly better, at 2.25.
Which suggests that a fair chunk of Mercedes' overall advantage so far this year is in Hamilton himself.
Another factor is that Alonso - who out-qualified Raikkonen by more than 0.5secs on average and 16-3 overall - is no longer in the Ferrari. Vettel's advantage over the Finn is just over half that so far. Where Alonso would be qualifying and racing this year's Ferrari can only be a matter of speculation.

Ferrari have undergone a major restructuring in the course of the last 18 months - including some major blood-letting of senior engineering staff at the end of last season.
Sacked were engine chief Luca Marmorini, engineering director Pat Fry, chief designer Nikolas Tombazis and tyre expert Hirohide Hamashima.
They paid the price for five years of failure and decline, which culminated in a 2014 car that was compromised from the start.
The chassis team asked the engine department for a number of features on the power-unit that would help them improve the car's aerodynamics.
This meant compromising the engine's performance because of restrictions imposed on packaging.
The aerodynamicists insisted this didn't matter, as they would make up the time loss and more in downforce. But they didn't. And given the much greater importance of the engine in the overall performance balance of the car in the new turbo hybrid formula, that was a major miscalculation.
This year, those engine compromises have been largely removed - leading to a dramatic step forward in power. But the team have still managed to improve downforce as well.
Some of the changes to the engine layout have actually improved aerodynamics, and had other positive knock-on effects.
For example, they have allowed a more pronounced curve in the so-called 'coke-bottle shape' - or waisted bodywork - at the rear. This enhances rear downforce, the lack of which was a major failing in last year's car.
That has allowed the team to run more front downforce and keep the car balanced, which was not possible last year. And that in turn gives a more positive turn-in to corners - which is exactly the characteristic both Vettel and Raikkonen need in a car to give their best.
While the ultra-adaptable Alonso managed to drive around some of the car's problems last year, Raikkonen could not. With the new Ferrari's more benign behaviour, both the team's current drivers can access more of their own potential and therefore the car's as well.
Technical director James Allison - who joined in September 2013, and had no input on the 2014 car at the conceptual stage and little on its design at all - says that ""in pure lap time, the gains are almost equal chassis to power unit"".
But this is almost certainly a politician's answer. The Mercedes teams believe the Ferrari engine is now effectively their equal. So while the Ferrari chassis is clearly much closer to the absolute pace than in 2014, it remains the biggest contributor to Ferrari's much smaller overall deficit to Mercedes.
Ferrari's chassis improvements have come about through Allison changing the focus of the design group.
""I haven't designed a single piece of this car,"" Allison says. ""There are a lot of very talented people who do that.
""If I have had any effect it is to try to say which bits are worth putting a lot of effort into, to try to make sure the pressure has been taken off people to deliver things for next week but to work with a slightly longer timescale in mind.
""It frees up your hand to do a good job. It is very hard to do anything in F1 on a two- to three-month timescale. You have to build up over months rather than weeks.""
The million-dollar question, then, is how long will it take for Ferrari to close the performance gap to Mercedes to nothing.
Ferrari have what Allison calls ""a fairly exciting development programme and a lot of performance to bring"".
On the engine, another 15bhp or so is due soon - most likely for the Canadian Grand Prix in early June.
Ferrari also have more scope to improve their engine than Mercedes. Out of the permitted 32 development 'tokens' - ascribed to parts of the engine depending on their influence on performance - they have saved 10 to use during the season, while Mercedes have only seven, having applied more over the winter.
""We will be shunting performance on to car as quick as we can find it and make it,"" Allison says. ""There's a bag load in the pipeline in the factory at the moment and that will get onto the car as soon as we can and there will be more coming after that.
""The aero programme is performing strongly and these are still quite young aero rules, so I think we can expect more from it. Ditto the engine. And the whole situation with the tokens means it's a very different year this year compared with last year. Notwithstanding the gains we've made to date, we think we can bring a lot more during the year.""
But Mercedes are not exactly going to be standing still. They, too, have significant upgrades coming on both car and engine.
""We have solid foundations in the team,"" Wolff says. ""We have built an organisation that can be successful on a sustainable basis long term, with the challenge of Ferrari bouncing back very strongly.""

In an attempt to stifle the 3-4-3 system that had earned Antonio Conte's side four consecutive Premier League wins before this match, Everton manager Ronald Koeman reverted to three men at the back.
However, the tactical ploy proved ineffective as the Dutchman's side were outpassed and outclassed by Conte's men in a mesmerising first-half display.
Confidence has been high among Chelsea's players since their 4-0 demolition of Manchester United last month, and the swagger with which they dismantled Everton will only further fuel talk of a title challenge.
In the five games since the formation change, Conte's side have scored 16 goals and conceded none.
Chelsea look a completely different team from the sluggish outfit that struggled under Jose Mourinho last season, and this performance was a real statement of intent.
Everton striker Romelu Lukaku would have been desperate to impress against former club Chelsea, but the Belgium international was a subdued presence.
Luakaku, who joined Everton from Chelsea for a club record £28m in July 2014, was barely able to get on the ball in the final third as Chelsea dominated.
Despite being paired with Yannick Bolasie, he was deprived of service, and spent large parts of the game chasing lost causes.
The 23-year-old has now played five Premier League matches for the Toffees against his former club, but is yet to score.
If Lukaku endured a frustrating game, the opposite was true for compatriot Hazard, who has rediscovered his joie de vivre and scored for a fourth consecutive league game.
Chelsea striker Diego Costa may have had a hand in more goals than any other Premier League player, with nine goals and three assists, but it is Hazard who has supporters on their feet whenever he is on the ball.
The effortless manner with which he glided past the dazed yellow shirts of Everton's defence for his two goals was breathtaking.
Conte claimed the 25-year-old forward is on the right track to becoming one of the world's best players, and on this evidence that is no exaggeration.
BBC Match Of The Day pundit Ian Wright said: ""Eden Hazard was world class against Everton. I think Ronald Koeman picked the wrong day to pick three at the back.""
Chelsea boss Antonio Conte: ""It was a great game, a good performance. It is important for confidence to be top of the league. We have to continue as Everton is now in the past.
""The players deserve this because they show me great commitment and I can tell they are working very hard. The team has more balance defensively, but we don't lose our offensive situation. We are creating more chances to score goals.
""Eden Hazard played an impressive game. We all know he is a talented player. I see he is working a lot for the team and his team-mates are very happy for this. He must continue - he is showing his talent in every game.""

""I expected more from my team. It was a big difference in every aspect.  It was not about the system - the difference was the mentality to win the game. With five defenders we control it, after 2-0 it was over.""

633,"While most commentators appear to agree that Mr Tsakalotos, 55, will be less bombastic than Mr Varoufakis in his dealings with international creditors, some argue that his negotiating stance could even be more hardline.
Mr Tsakalotos  is a Dutch-born, Oxford University-educated economics professor who served as minister for international economic affairs before taking over from Mr Varoufakis as Greece's lead negotiator in its debt talks in April.
A long-serving member of the governing Syriza party - in contrast to Mr Varoufakis - he was the obvious choice to become the new finance minister. His less confrontational style is certain to be welcomed by creditors - although few expect him to be a pushover.
In a rare interview with the French newspaper Liberation last month, Mr Varoufakis argued that Greece's creditors ""did not appear prepared to compromise"" and seemed determined to impose ""unrealistic"" demands.
""Our interlocutors each time insist on pension cuts. It's unrealistic [to ask for that] in a country where pensions have been considerably reduced over the past five years, and where two in three pensioners live under the poverty line,"" he said.
Showing the same fondness as Mr Tsakalotos for rhetorical flourishes, he argued in March that Greece was ""not asking for special treatment, but for equal treatment in a Europe of equals"".
Mr Tsakalotos insisted that the Syriza government was ""fundamentally pro-Europe"" and that it wanted ""a viable economic programme inside the euro"".
A mild-mannered married father-of-three, the new finance minister has spent much of his professional life working as an academic outside Greece, a fact that sometimes comes across in an English tilt to his accent. He returned to his country to work at Athens University in the early 1990s.
It was during his time at Oxford University that he joined the student wing of Greece's eurocommunist party, motivated by what he saw as the unjust treatment of the Greek left - who spearheaded the resistance against Nazi occupation - in the civil war that followed World War Two.
Mr Tsakalotos will face a stern challenge in his new role at the finance ministry.
Correspondents say that his immediate priority will be to get the the European Central Bank to provide an emergency injection of euros before Greece's banks run out of cash - something that it is feared could happen imminently despite more than a week of capital controls.
He will then have to persuade eurozone leaders to give Greece another chance at negotiating a bailout in addition to convincing creditors to discuss a restructuring of his country's massive debt.
If that fails, Mr Tsakalotos will face the agony of negotiating a divorce that he has always maintained that he does not want to happen - a Greek exit from the euro.

""When the EU is gone, those powers haven't gone anywhere, they will still be here where they have been since 1999.
""Our anxiety is that there are some people in the UK government who appear to believe that without the European Union somehow those powers are floating free and they will hang onto them and then say they'll hand them to us - they already lie with us.""
Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said the Repeal Bill would offer devolved administrations the opportunity to extend their powers.
""We've been absolutely clear... no decisions that the Welsh Government or any of the other nations or devolved administrations take at the moment will be removed from them,"" he said.","Welsh ministers are frustrated that the UK government has not accepted more of their help before Brexit negotiations, Wales' finance secretary has said.",39437582
638,"Shahak Shapira, who is Jewish, said he had reported 300 incidents of hate speech in six months, but Twitter had responded to just nine.
A YouTube video has emerged showing Mr Shapira stencilling 30 tweets.
""Germany needs a final solution to Islam,"" reads one.
""Let's gas the Jews,"" says another, in reference to the Nazis' murder of six million Jews during World War Two.
""If Twitter forces me to see these things, then they'll have to see them too,"" the artist said in the video, posted on Monday.
He described the comments as ""not just plain insults or jokes, but absolutely serious threats of violence"".
They include statements that are homophobic, xenophobic, or involve holocaust denial.
He said the nine responses he got from Twitter said the tweets did not violate the site's rules.
""I haven't received a single mail telling me a tweet was actually removed,"" he said.
Mr Shapira explained in the video, titled #HeyTwitter, that he had made stencils of the hate-filled messages, then travelled to Hamburg to paint them in front of the platform's headquarters.
""Tomorrow,"" he said, ""they will have to look at all the beautiful tweets their company loves to ignore so much.""
Hate speech is an especially sensitive subject in Germany due to the crimes committed by the Nazi regime in World War Two.
In June, the country passed a law which could force social media companies to delete racist or slanderous posts within 24 hours or face a fine of up to €50m ($58m; £45m).
Mr Shapira said he had reported 150 comments to Facebook during the same six-month period, and 80% were removed within one to three days.
Twitter's head of public policy for Europe, Karen White, told Reuters: ""Over the past six months, we've introduced a host of new tools and features to improve Twitter for everyone. We've also improved the in-app reporting process for our users and we continue to review and iterate on our policies and their enforcement.""
The site is said to be acting against 10 times as many abusive accounts as it did this time last year.
Mr Shapira previously made headlines after taking a controversial stand against selfie-taking at Berlin's Holocaust memorial.
He copied 12 selfies snapped at the memorial from social media, and published them on a website called ""Yolocaust"" - a combination of the popular social media hashtag Yolo - ""you only live once"" - and Holocaust.
Each image was altered so that hovering over it stripped away the background of the memorial and replaced it with scenes from concentration camps.
He said at the time: ""Lets see what happens, let's see how many stupid, inappropriate pictures I have to see on the internet.
""And if you're asking me is this right or wrong, then that's a good thing. It doesn't have to be one or the other, just having the debate is good.""",A German satirist who claims Twitter is failing to delete hate speech has captured the firm's attention offline - by stencilling the offending messages outside its Hamburg office.,40870447

Chairman Jonathan Browning said the governing body will be making changes to be more caring to riders.
""Where there are failings we apologise,"" Browning told BBC sports editor Dan Roan.
He added the organisation would also address concerns raised by MPs at a select committee hearing into doping.
An investigation into the culture at British Cycling was launched last year after ex-riders complained about their treatment.
A report on the findings of the investigation is imminent.
But the governing body says work on an action plan to address any ""failings"" is already under way.
""Athlete and participant welfare is our highest priority,"" said Browning.
He said the organisation had achieved ""remarkable success"" in not only winning races, but bringing new people into the sport.
However, he added: ""We deeply regret any instance where we have failed to deliver.""
He accepted there had been ""well reported"" incidences where behaviour had been ""unacceptable"" and needed to be addressed.
""My ambition for athletes is anyone leaving the programme says 'I would recommend it to my younger brother or sister',"" he said.
Browning said British Cycling was now ""committed to implementing the recommendations of the independent review in full"" to ensure the best possible environment in which its athletes could flourish.
The action plan aims include:
The independent review was commissioned last April by British Cycling alongside UK Sport, which provides elite funding to the organisation.
It came after former technical director Shane Sutton, who was was later cleared of eight of nine allegations, was found to have used sexist language towards cyclist Jess Varnish.
UK Sport chief executive Liz Nicholl says the independent review has ""identified valuable lessons"" both for British Cycling and other sports it funds.
The organisation set out its own action plan to help British Cycling, which includes ""placing more emphasis on the importance of culture and duty of care"".
Browning added: ""Athlete development has been and will continue to be the key to our success at the highest level.
""This is not about complying to protect funding, this is about running and leading our organisation in a way that is consistent with our ambition to be a world-class governing body and a great place to work.""

The release of British Cycling's action plan comes a day after MP Damian Collins said the body's credibility was ""in tatters"" following a separate inquiry into doping.
MPs heard ""some detailed and worrying"" evidence from former British Cycling coach Simon Cope and UK Anti-Doping chief Nicole Sapstead, covering poor record-keeping of riders' medical details to the mysterious contents of a jiffy bag delivered from British Cycling to Team Sky at a race in France.
Browning, who only took on the role of chairman last month, said he had been left ""really disappointed"" by the hearing, adding: ""We're still looking for clear answers. Not only do we need to be clean but we have to be able to demonstrate it.
""I've not come across any evidence of cheating. I've found an organisation that's changed quickly and needs to reset its priorities - it's something we are going to fix.""","The head of British Cycling has apologised for ""failings"" following accusations of bullying and sexism against top-level cyclists.",39140041
640,"The workers at Rotherwas munitions factory included 4,000 women, who were known as the ""canary girls"" because many contracted jaundice through the work, which turned their skin yellow.
Historian Julie Orton-Jones believes more than 200 of the women died during the war.
Now a history group is calling for a permanent memorial.
The factory was constructed by the Ministry of Munitions and shell filling began there on 11 November 1916.
Workers were brought from all over Great Britain and Ireland.
At the factory's peak, almost 6,000 people worked there including 4,000 women.
""It was very intense and dangerous work,"" said Neil Kerr from the Hereford Enterprise Zone, which now operates on the Rotherwas site.
""The recruits who came in were girls from the farms and domestic servants - they came in and they suddenly started getting real wages.""
However, the chemicals in the explosives caused many of the women to contract toxic jaundice, which turned their hair and skin yellow and caused tooth decay.
Ms Orton-Jones from Herefordshire Lore, the history group which is campaigning for a permanent memorial, said some of the women had suffered lifelong health problems.
""It did affect them horribly with lung and throat infections,"" she said. ""Some of them died - I believe around 210 in World War One. That's an awful lot of girls.""
Barrington Mayne, whose mother Cissie was a munitions worker in World War Two, said he felt the factory's staff had been forgotten.
""Without their involvement, it would have been very difficult on the war front,"" he said.

641,"More and more, financial firms are turning to machines to do the job humans have done for decades.
Last spring, wealth management firm Charles Schwab launched a new service called Schwab Intelligent Portfolios. The service is unique in that it's not a person who decides where to invest your money, it's an algorithm - lines of code programmed into a computer.
""It's lower cost for the investor,"" says Tobin McDaniel, who leads the Schwab Intelligent Portfolios team.
""As opposed to working with a traditional advisor where you might pay up to 1%, here you get portfolio management at essentially no management fee.""
To get started with Schwab Intelligent Portfolios, you answer a short questionnaire aimed at determining your appetite for risk and your investment goals. Algorithms then create a portfolio suited to your profile and manage it on a daily basis.
Instead of simply crunching numbers, the machines are now making decisions.
And that increasingly describes the rest of the financial system.
Machines are now responsible for most of the activity on Wall Street.
And just this summer, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Group closed most of its trading pits after 167 years.
The practice of traders shouting and using hand signals to buy and sell commodities had become outdated. The work they once did has been replaced by a much quieter competitor - the computer.
Brad Bailey is a research director at Celent, and an expert on electronic trading.
""Before we were limited to human response time, which is about half of a second or about the blink of an eye,"" he says
""Now when you think about trading, things are happening in nanoseconds, or certainly milliseconds.""
Supporters say computers boost liquidity, helping would-be buyers and sellers find one another without middlemen.
Then there are the high frequency traders. They zip in and out of shares so quickly, and on such a massive scale, that their fortunes are lost and made by tiny price movements.
Other algorithms rely more on artificial intelligence to pour over earnings statements, news reports and regulatory filings looking for clues on how to view a stock.
While these lines of code are faster and more efficient than people, Brad Bailey warns that ""[a] lot can happen in those time frames before humans can react"".
Not all of it good.
In 2012 US market maker Knight Capital lost over $400m (Â£261m) in 30 minutes because of a computer glitch. And this summer trading was halted at the New York Stock Exchange following a software problem.
These events have raised doubts about the stability of computerised trading systems. Critics argue it has made markets more volatile.
And what about trading rules? Are they fit for purpose with markets that now handle orders in milliseconds?
""We live in a world where you can't prevent every problem,"" says Ron Geffner, a former Securities and Exchange Commission attorney who now works with hedge funds.
""It takes time for regulators to spot the problems, become aware of it, and once they become aware of it to adopt rules.""
To prevent big swings, US financial regulators have implemented a raft of measures including single stock circuit breakers. The rule requires a pause in trading for individual stocks if the price moves 10% or more in a five-minute period.
And companies like Charles Schwab have also instituted safeguards.
Just this August, when the Dow fell more than 1,000 points during the trading session, Charles Schwab convened a panel of people to check if the huge volume of orders its Schwab Intelligent Portfolios was about to place was the right move.

642,"The sites were subject to about 144,000 hacking attacks each month last year, two thirds of which came from the US, according to China's defence ministry.
The issue of cyber hacking has strained relations between the two countries.
Earlier this month a US cyber security firm said a secretive Chinese military unit was behind ""prolific hacking"".
Mandiant said that Unit 61398 was believed to have ""systematically stolen hundreds of terabytes of data"" from at least 141 organisations around the world.
The White House has said that it has taken its concerns about cyber-theft to the highest levels of China's government. China denied the allegations,  saying it was also the victim of cyber attacks.
The US is yet to respond to these latest allegations from China.
""The Defence Ministry and China Military Online websites have faced a serious threat from hacking attacks since they were established,"" defence ministry spokesman Geng Yansheng is quoted by Reuters news agency as saying at a monthly press conference.
He added that the number of attacks on these sites  had steadily increased over the years.
An analysis of the IP addresses involved showed that officials had ascertained that attacks from the US accounted for 62.9 percent of the attacks made on these two website in 2012, according to Mr Geng.
He also said that reported US plans to expand its cyber warfare capabilities were unlikely to foster international collaboration.
""We hope that the U.S. side can explain and clarify this,"" he said.
It is believed to be the first time that Chinese officials have provided such details about alleged US-based attacks on their own systems.
However, Beijing has been accused by several governments, foreign companies and organisations of carrying out extensive cyber espionage for many years, seeking to gather information and to control China's image.
In late January, the New York Times said that hackers from China had ""persistently"" infiltrated the paper over the previous four months, saying the attacks had coincided with its reports into the wealth of the family of Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao.
At the time China's foreign ministry dismissed those accusations as ""groundless"".","Hackers from the US have repeatedly launched attacks on two Chinese military websites, including that of the Defence Ministry, officials say.",21615448
643,"These wild relatives are closely related to our crops, but grow naturally under a wide range of environmental conditions.
This makes them essential for the development of more resistant and adaptable food sources.
However, many of them grow in conflict zones in the Middle East, where their conservation is threatened.
Scientists from the University of Birmingham have highlighted ""hotspots"" around the globe, which are areas where many different types of wild relatives are concentrated. Here, they could be conserved to secure future global food resources.
Farmers crossbreed the wild relatives with existing crops to produce varieties of grains, vegetables, fruits, legumes and tubers that are more adaptable to local climates.
Lead scientist Dr Nigel Maxted from the University of Birmingham told BBC News: ""Our goal is not only crop wild relative conservation, but to promote use of the conserved diversity by farmers and breeders to develop crop varieties with greater resilience to climate change.""
The wild species may contain many useful traits, such as drought tolerance or resilience to pests and diseases.
For example, Aegilops tauschii, the wild relative of wheat, is resistant to the Hessian fly, which is a pest of cereal crops; Saccharum arundinaceum, a relative of sugar cane, can survive very low temperatures; Prunus ferganensis, the wild version of peach, is tolerant to droughts.
Dr Nigel Maxted said: ""There has previously been no opportunity to systematically conserve and use crop wild relatives at a global scale as there was a lack of clarity over their identities and distribution.
""By creating an inventory we can discover which countries and regions are the richest in terms of priority crop wild relatives, and we can then more efficiently plan and coordinate conservation efforts to target their survival.""
The inventory lists 173 crops and their 1,667 priority wild relatives, along with their traits and location.
Mr Mike Ambrose, from the department of crop genetics at the John Innes Centre in Norwich, is a user of the database and has provided his knowledge of peas during its compilation.
He explained: ""It is a very interactive database with a lot of functionality and completely open and free.
""Its creation has involved many experts from around the world, interacting and providing input to develop it and complete what is a global resource.""
The researchers have found that 12% of the crop wild relatives are threatened by extinction and all are likely to have suffered a loss of genetic diversity due to urbanisation, climate change and conflict in hotspot areas.
Half of the priority species in temperate regions are located in the Fertile Crescent, an area that arcs around the Near East.
Ongoing conflict in some of these areas makes the access to crop wild relatives difficult, but the team of scientists, together with the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the UN, are now working on strategies to protect the hotspots.
The plan is to store the wild relatives' genetic information in gene banks, where the material can be kept for up to 300 years, as well as to conserve the crop relatives in the wild.
""It is very important that we conserve these species in secure gene banks, but it is also critical to conserve them in their natural habitat as well so they will continue to adapt to changes in the climate as well as threats from pests and diseases,"" added Dr Nigel Maxted.
""The global population is now 7.3 billion and by 2050 it will be 9.6 billion, so it is now even more crucial that we conserve crop wild relatives as part of the wider need to address global food security issues.""",Scientists have released the most complete database of the wild relatives of common food crops.,29086719

AWE had spent £3.96bn by the end of the 2015/16 financial year, a Freedom of Information (FoI) request has revealed.
An AWE spokesman said the money spent was part of ""annually agreed funding"".
Three out of five planned projects at the sites in Aldermaston and Burghfield were completed on time in 2015.
However, the Ministry of Defence's (MoD) response to the FoI revealed that AWE was now expected to complete projects Pegasus and Mensa in 2020.
Pegasus will store and handle enriched uranium components for nuclear warheads, and Mensa is where the weapons will be assembled.

Mr Abbott said he had taken time out to assess his future since losing the leadership and was heartened by the support that he had received from his constituents.
""Therefore, I am renominating to represent the people of Warringah for another term as their Liberal MP,"" he said.
Mr Abbott's decision to stay in politics immediately drew comparisons to Kevin Rudd, the Labor prime minister who was dumped by his own party in 2010.

England lost their first game, against West Indies, but recovered superbly to win their next three against South Africa, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka.
""There is a a lot of excitement around the group,"" added Morgan. ""Having done enough to get out of the group stages and play in a World Twenty20 semi-final, the guys are really excited.
""We have built a lot of confidence. We also showed a lot of character at different stages.
""We showed our development as a side in chasing down 230, our grit against Afghanistan and we played a lot of smart cricket against Sri Lanka.""
England's limited-overs performance in India is a marked improvement on the one they produced in last year's 50-over World Cup, from which they eliminated in the group stages having won just two of their six games.

But there are details to fill in, and this is the first stage of a two-part consultation.
The Institute for Public Policy Research says the change is not so burdensome for domestic car owners as there is a big choice in the car showroom, and competitive prices.
But innovation has been slower in the commercial vehicle sector, which means there are not many cheap options on the market for van owners at the moment.
The mayor would not say whether he would offer exemptions or discounts over a transitional period.
His answer is to push the responsibility to government which - he says - should introduce a diesel scrappage scheme as soon as possible.
The Federation of Small Businesses said although it supported the plans in principle, it was concerned about the cost of implementing them.
Sue Terpilowski OBE, London Policy chair at the organisation, said: ""Micro and small businesses face disproportionately higher costs than medium and large-sized ones in carrying out business activities.
""We do not want to see tradesmen, coach companies, construction business owners or market traders refusing to serve London, which is why transport policy in London needs to recognise the difference between essential and non-essential journeys.""
Motoring group the RAC said it feared bringing in the Ultra Low Emission Zone a year earlier could unfairly penalise businesses who had recently bought diesel vehicles in good faith thinking they were doing the right thing for the environment thanks to their lower CO2 emissions.
It added that more was needed to be done to improve congestion as it said data had indicated that some average traffic speeds in London were ""slower than those in the horse and cart era"".
Caroline Pidgeon, Liberal Democrat London Assembly Member, said the measures did not go far enough.
She called for more charging points for electric vehicles and for Transport for London to bulk purchase electric taxis to help drive down their price and to then lease or sell them on to taxi drivers or garages.
The announcement was made at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH).
Its chief executive, Dr Peter Steer, said: ""Children living in highly polluted areas are four times more likely to have reduced lung function in adulthood, yet improving air quality has been shown to halt and reverse this effect.
""When the UK's most seriously ill children come to GOSH for world class care, we want to ensure that they are not exposed to high levels of harmful pollution and so we are pleased improving London's air quality is a priority for the Mayor.""

655,"The comic actor and author plays Tommy Beresford to Jessica Raine's Tuppence Beresford in a six-part period drama based on two novels by Agatha Christie.
""I like that Tommy has to defer to her; that she is more intelligent and heroic than he is,"" Walliams went on.
Partners in Crime is scheduled to air on BBC One at the end of July.
The drama, screened to reporters in London on Monday, forms part of a series of BBC programmes marking the 125th anniversary of Christie's birth.
Tommy and Tuppence have not been seen on British TV since the 1980s, in which they were played, on ITV, by James Warwick and Francesca Annis.
The characters went on to spawn a trio of French films, starring Andre Dussollier and Catherine Frot, that renamed the characters Belisaire and Prudence.
The sleuthing duo also appeared in a 2006 edition of the Marple TV series, in which they were played by Anthony Andrews and Greta Scacchi.
""These characters have not been done for a while and I thought it would be a good opportunity to do a new version,"" said Walliams on Monday.
""Something about having a husband and wife detective duo really appealed,"" he went on. ""I don't think there's been one since Hart to Hart.""
Hart to Hart, which ran from 1979 to 1984 before being revived in the 1990s, starred Robert Wagner and Stefanie Powers as a pair of wealthy married sleuths.
Call the Midwife star Raine described her character as ""forward-looking and modern"". ""It's so nice to play a woman who isn't put-upon or a victim,"" she continued.
""I like how front-footed and quick-witted she is. She's quite funny and intelligent and curious, all these things you want to be in real life.""
Raine, whose other recent drama credits include Wolf Hall and Fortitude, said she also enjoyed the physical nature of the role.
""I got to do some great stunts - to smash windows and climb through windows and have a full-on fist fight with another woman,"" she explained.
In contrast, joked Walliams, his more passive part in proceedings found him more often seen ""busy helping myself to some biscuits"".
More Clouseau than Poirot, Tommy Beresford is depicted as a well-meaning but ineffectual man whose lofty plans have yet to yield results.
""Tommy's a good man but he's let his ambitions slide,"" explained Walliams. ""He needs Tuppence to help him make something of his life.""
The couple are introduced in the first half of the series, based on Christie's 1922 novel The Secret Adversary, as a bickering couple who are often at odds.
""But there's a real love underneath the bickering, and over the course of the series they re-find that love,"" said Raine, who described her on-screen relationship with Walliams as ""funny and zesty and fresh"".
Both Walliams and Raine expressed a willingness to return to their roles, though the former pointed out there are only so many novels and stories to adapt.
""There are only five Tommy and Tuppence books"" - four novels and a collection of short stories - ""so we would have to invent a few more,"" he explained.
A three-part adaptation of And Then There Were None, Christie's most-read book, is also being made to mark the anniversary of Agatha Christie's birth.
Best known for his Little Britain partnership with Matt Lucas, Walliams is also a successful children's author and a judge on Britain's Got Talent.","Little Britain star David Walliams has described his new role as one half of a husband and wife detective duo as ""the damsel in distress"" of the partnership.",33310764
656,"The official figures for April to September mark the half-way mark of the 2015-16 financial year - and mean the deficit has grown from the £930m posted in the first three months.
Regulators have described the problems as the ""worst for a generation"".
The figures cover 241 trusts running hospital, mental health, ambulance and some community services.
Between them they account for about two-thirds of the NHS's £116bn budget - with the rest going on other areas including GPs, drug prescribing and training.
Overall, eight in 10 trusts were in deficit by the end of September.
It means the combined overspend is already nearly double what it was for the entire 2014-15 financial year.
Then, the NHS finished £822m in the red - with the health service as a whole balancing the books only after a cash injection from the Treasury and by raiding the capital budget earmarked for buildings.
Overspending on agency staff has been highlighted as one of the major problems as well as rising demand for services - and there will now be further pressure on health bosses to cut back on spending.
The regulators also warned hospitals were facing growing problems discharging patients - this happens when there are not enough services available in the community either from councils or the NHS to care for the most vulnerable.
The news comes at a difficult time for the NHS. Performance is already suffering with many of the major targets, including ones for A&E, ambulances and cancer care, being missed, while health chiefs are having to prepare for three days of industrial action by junior doctors.
The release of the figures by the regulators Monitor and the Trust Development Authority comes ahead of the spending review next week when Chancellor George Osborne will announced his plans for this Parliament.
The government has promised the NHS an extra £8bn by 2020. Health service leaders have called for that money to be ""front-loaded"" so that most of it comes in the first few years to help them get on top of the pressures.
Jim Mackey, the incoming chief executive of the regulatory bodies, said the current situation was ""really challenging"".
Anita Charlesworth, chief economist at the Health Foundation, said: ""The figures confirm the truly dire state of NHS finances.
""Next week's spending review needs to address the unprecedented scale of challenge.""
Meanwhile, the BBC has learnt that, ahead of the spending review, there is consideration being given to cutting some parts of health spending.
The promises made by government have been specifically aimed at the front-line of the NHS.

658,"Evans, 53, was relieved of his duties at Elland Road on Tuesday.
The Scot was the sixth head coach to work under Cellino since April 2014.
""In the last week or two it became obvious that I was not going to be around. I don't feel disrespected, I had a good working relationship with Mr Cellino,"" Evans told BBC Radio Leeds.
""The club secretary Stuart Hayton conveyed to me that my contract would not be extended beyond the end of the season and it was handled in a very professional phone call.
""I spoke to Massimo earlier in the summer but not in recent days or weeks.
""I certainly felt we had done enough to go forward but you don't make that decision as a manager. That lies with the owner and the board. I have to accept it, as much as I am saddened by it.""
MK Dons boss Karl Robinson and Bristol Rovers manager Darrell Clarke have both turned down the opportunity to succeed Evans.
The former Rotherham boss, who had promised fans he would secure a play-off finish next season, believes the club need to hire an experienced British coach.
""It has to be a strong character and someone who is going to be very focused and understanding of what the remit is,"" he said.
""I was very clear that if Leeds United's aims for next season were to finish in the play-offs then that would be happening under Steve Evans and Paul Raynor.
""I can only take that the benchmark has been raised after the statement that Massimo put out yesterday, so if I was a Leeds United supporter I would be getting excited for a strong British coach.""",Former Leeds head coach Steve Evans says he was content with the way his departure was handled despite not being told by chairman Massimo Cellino.,36426711
659,"The public sector deficit is the amount that the government spends minus the amount that it receives in taxes, after you've taken into account investment.
The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast of whether the deficit will go up or down in the current financial year will be a big focus in the Autumn Statement on 3 December.
At the end of last week, it looked as if this year's deficit would be going up by £1.7bn as a result of a backdated bill for UK contributions to the EU Budget.
But then, as a result of Chancellor George Osborne's negotiations, it turned out that we would have nothing to add to this year's deficit and ""only"" £850m to add to next year's, which would be after the general election.
On Wednesday, the Treasury discovered it would be receiving an extra £1.1bn (minus costs) as a result of the fines imposed on banks by the Financial Conduct Authority for traders' attempted manipulation of foreign exchange rates.
Mr Osborne said that the fines would be used ""for the wider public good"", which could mean they go towards reducing the deficit. Alternatively, as was the case with the Libor fines, some of the money could go towards other good causes.
The point is, the deficit could go up or down by a billion pounds or so for unexpected reasons, which could make all the difference between a rising deficit and falling one.
In the first six months of the current financial year, the deficit excluding public sector banks was £45.7bn, up from £44.8bn in the first six months of last year, but down from £50.6bn in the same period the year before. £2.8bn would have reversed that rise.
We've also recently had a warning from the OBR that it expects to lower its forecast for the amount of tax the government will collect this year.
All this makes it likely that the OBR will predict that this year's deficit will end up higher than last year's, despite government cost-cutting and a growing economy.
And you have to feel the OBR's pain when it attempts to make these forecasts. It has been very wrong with some of its forecasting since it was created in 2010, although admittedly not much more wrong than other forecasters.
Even so, how are you supposed to make forecasts when you never know where an extra billion pounds or two could come from?","We've had two examples in the last week of why it's so hard to predict the deficit, which may end up knocking almost £2.8bn off the figure, writes Anthony Reuben.",30019025

They will now play a single date at the Etihad Stadium on 18 June instead.

Bandmate Mark Owen dedicated the concert to ""everyone who has been affected by the events that happened in Manchester last Monday night"".
He added: ""All profits from tonight will be going to We Love Manchester emergency fund.""
The fund was set up by Manchester City Council and the British Red Cross to raise money for those who were bereaved or injured as a result of the attack on the Ariana Grande concert at the arena.
It has raised more than £5m so far, with former Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher and rapper Eminem among the other music stars to have pledged money.
Take That's show at Liverpool's Echo Arena was originally scheduled for Tuesday, but was postponed to Friday by the band ""out of respect"" for the victims and their families.
On stage, the band paused after the first song to give their response to the week's events.
Howard Donald said: ""As you know, I was born and raised in Manchester, so at this moment in time, I've never been so proud to be a Mancunian.
""Thank you so much, thanks for coming and enjoy the night please.""

662,"The rally was mostly on behalf of Tamil people.
Many protesters were prevented by the authorities from attending, but a big pro-government demonstration was allowed to go ahead.
Tamil Tiger rebels fought a 26-year war for a separate state in the north and east before they were defeated in 2009.
Rights activists say that some of those who disappeared were fighting for the Tamil Tigers, some fought for the government and some were civilians.
They say that many Tamils remain in the hands of the security forces.
They want a UN-led international probe into alleged human rights abuses during the war, but the government has rejected the demand and denies being responsible for most of the disappearances.
Opposition politician and anti-disappearances campaigner Mano Ganeshan told the AP news agency that buses packed with about 1,000 Tamils were prevented from leaving the northern town of Vavuniya on Tuesday to make the 210km (130-mile) journey to Colombo for Wednesday's protest.
He said that government forces and police had intimidated the bus drivers, warning them not to proceed with the journey.
However, military spokesman Brig Ruwan Wanigasooriya said that police had stopped the buses to prevent possible clashes in Vavuniya.
He said complaints were made to police earlier on Tuesday that people had thrown stones at the buses.
The US embassy in Colombo has expressed concern about the Vavuniya reports. It has called on the Sri Lankan government to allow free movement of its citizens ""calling for information about their missing loved ones"".
One of those attending the Colombo protest, Perinparani, told the BBC's Charles Haviland that her son Pradeepan, 20,  was taken from her in the northern town of Jaffna in 2008.
""The army officers came in four field motorbikes,"" she said.
""There were about eight army officers, with beards. These people came and took him. They had no letter, they didn't tell me why they were taking my son away.""
Her son was a labourer with no connection to the rebels, she said.
Her repeated visits to prisons have yielded little information. At the rally in Colombo, she and other distressed parents held up photos of their missing children.

The UN Security Council said on Thursday it was not ready to back a West African intervention force in northern Mali, but instead passed a resolution calling for sanctions against the groups.
Unicef said as well as abuse and the use of children as fighters, children have also been killed and maimed by landmines and other ordnance.
It went on to say that about 300,000 children have been affected by the closure of schools in unstable areas.
Since rebels took control of the north of Mali, many children have been living in camps where they face food shortages, Unicef said.
The UN said the information they had presented was only a partial picture, however, as it was too dangerous to undertake proper research in northern Mali.
Unicef said it was working with partners in certain areas of the country in an attempt to help communities to protect children.
""Children in the north are witnessing or becoming victims of violence and they must be protected,"" said Theophane Nikyema, Unicef's Mali representative.

Labour London Assembly member and former Tower Hamlets leader Mr Biggs stood as a candidate against Mr Rahman, the incumbent Tower Hamlets mayor in the May 2014 election.
He came second to Mr Rahman, receiving 32.82% of first preference votes.

666,"MPs voted 284 to 259 in favour of an amendment allowing landlords an independent rent review and to buy their beer on the open market.
So-called ""tied pubs"" are required to buy supplies - often at high prices - from the companies that own the pubs.
Campaigners said the ""historic"" vote would help ""secure the future of the Great British pub"".
The amendment to the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Bill was put forward by Lib Dem Greg Mulholland.
Mr Mulholland, the chairman of the all-party Parliamentary Save the Pub group, described the ""tie"" arrangement made between a pub and its owner as an ""archaic"" and ""extraordinary"" system.
It is thought to be the government's first defeat on one of its own bills since the 2010 election.
Ministers want to create a pubs code, aimed at helping pub landlords struggling to pay rent or beer costs.
It includes the right to request a rent review after five years.
But campaigners wanted the automatic right for pub landlords to exchange their tenancy for an independently-assessed market rent without any ""tie"".
In an attempt to head off a defeat on the amendment, which was signed by MPs of all parties, Business Minister Jo Swinson said the government would introduce new measures to allow pub landlords to apply for ""market rent"" rates from after two years, if a review found other measures in the bill had not helped them sufficiently.
But Mr Mulholland said this would be ""business as usual"".
He told MPs the new clause, which was backed by Labour, had been drafted by lawyers and publicans and would come in gradually, reducing the impact on the industry.
He added: ""This is a reasonable gradual process that will simply bring back market forces into a sector that frankly has become grotesquely anti-competitive.""
Tim Page, chief executive of the Campaign for Real Ale, said he was ""delighted"" that ""after 10 years of our campaigning, MPs have today voted to introduce a market rent only option for licensees tied to the large pub companies - a move that will secure the future of the Great British pub"".

667,"It highlights cycling, tackling pollution and protecting investment as key areas.
Scratch below the surface though and the unknowns are very clear.
TfL's business plan under the previous mayor, Boris Johnson, was based on fares going up at inflation (the retail price index - RPI) or RPI +1%.
That meant with a set income, big cuts were not necessary. That led to TfL becoming -  according to Mr Khan - ""flabby"" and inefficient.
This business plan is different - that is not to say it isn't achievable - but the challenges are much larger.
Over five years there is the big cut of £2.8bn in the grant from central government, on top of that Mr Khan's TfL's fare freeze, costing £640m.
Money has to found for both.
The mayor says he is bringing in efficiencies, but the cuts imposed by government are far bigger. And his agenda does make it difficult for him to criticise transport cuts of any sort.
So to balance the books, TfL will have to make cuts of £4bn out of its five year turnover of £45bn - or £800m a year.
Where the cuts will land are not yet completely clear but it will be ""the biggest ever overhaul of our organisation"" says the Transport Commissioner Mike Brown.
Broadly, we are told procurement from suppliers - it is hoped - will see huge savings, as will IT projects.
There will also be job losses. Some 49 senior managers have already gone and agency staff and consultants will also be reduced.
Crucially operating costs will also not be able to rise by much at all  - even if inflation goes up.
""To achieve our milestones we must increase the use of public transport in the short run, primarily by attracting customers back to the bus service,"" the TfL draft business plans says.
""In the medium term we must ensure the Elizabeth Line opens on schedule and carries the projected 232 million passengers a year, resulting in £0.7bn in fare revenue growth over the plan.
""This must be achieved while operating costs are held down by absorbing inflation and the additional costs of running the Elizabeth Line.""
On the buses there has been a 5% drop in a passenger numbers. Rectifying that is mentioned a number of times.
The report says: ""We must attract customers back on to our buses. This is vital because fares income represents, proportionately, a greater slice of total income..""
To do that the mayor needs to solve congestion in London which has seen average speeds drop to 7.8mph.
That is extremely challenging - not many cities have done it - especially with many big construction projects in London and a growing population. Could we see the congestion charge increased?
The Elizabeth Line is another unknown. The plan expects it to generate more than £2bn in fares over the next five years.
That is without knowing the fare structure for the service.
There is also politics in the business plan.
Some £20m is set aside to take over suburban rail services if the government changes its mind and decides to give TfL the Southeastern franchise.
On that issue the mayor is treading a thin line.
On the one hand he calls TfL ""flabby"", on the other he wants the government to hand over rail services to - by his own definition - an inefficient organisation.

668,"And whether you prefer sun, sand and sangria or meze, Metaxa and monuments, it can't have escaped your notice that the whole getting-away-from-it-all thing is a lot more expensive at the moment.
At least, that is, if you're a Brit bound for the eurozone.
The pound is touching 10-month lows against the euro at the moment at 1.0981 euros.
And currency strategists at US investment bank Morgan Stanley are even forecasting that the euro could move ""beyond parity"" with the pound on the currency markets for the first time ever in early 2018.
The last time the rate was within even spitting distance of that was back in 2008, when it was languishing at about 1.0200 euros.
Of course, there have been well-publicised occasions, even in the the past year, when people have got less than one euro to the pound at some currency exchanges.
But if that barrier were breached on the wholesale markets, it would be a ""hugely important psychological"" event, one unheard-of in the currency's 18-year history.
Of course, every cloud, as they say: the weak pound has attracted huge numbers of tourists from the eurozone to the UK.
April saw a record 2.93 million eurozone visitors - up from 2.499 million in April of last year, according to the Office for National Statistics.
The pound has been buying fewer euros since it fell sharply on 24 June 2016, the day after the UK voted in a referendum to leave the European Union.
But other factors are also playing their part. So just what is driving the relationship between sterling and the euro at the moment?
The first thing to say is that it is primarily about euro strength rather than pound weakness.
Simon Derrick, chief currency strategist at financial institution BNY Mellon, reckons there have been two key factors recently which have stoked the euro's strength.
The first was that earlier in the year, there was a lot of political uncertainty in the eurozone, not least about the outcome of the French presidential election, and that drove the euro lower.
The National Front, led by Marine Le Pen, wanted France to abandon the euro - a move which could have caused turmoil in the eurozone - and even the European Union as a whole.
However, when it became clear that Emmanuel Macron was likely to win, ""a lot of the political concerns started to dissipate"", says Mr Derrick.
""As political tensions eased, it made the currency look rather more attractive.""
Another ""significant factor"" boosting the euro is anticipation on the markets that the European Central Bank will start cutting back on its Quantitative Easing programme, says Mr Derrick.
This has seen it pumping 60bn euros a month into the eurozone economy, in an effort to bolster its performance.
Essentially, that has meant huge amounts of euros sloshing around the system, keeping the value of the euro down.
However, if that changes, then the pressure on the euro will be lifted.
It's a question of supply and demand.
""The market has this expectation that at some point between now and the end of the year, the ECB will say something about further reducing the QE programme and as a result, the euro's been going up,"" says Mr Derrick.
Not only because it will mean less money in the system, but also because it will be a sign that the ECB thinks the eurozone economy can manage without so much support.
There's a flip side to the relationship, of course: what's happening to sterling.
Ahead of August's Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee meeting, some people had been wondering if there would be signs that more members of the committee were in favour of raising interest rates.
When it became clear that wasn't the case, people were disappointed. That put pressure on sterling, because lower interest rates make a currency less attractive to foreign investors, explains Mr Derrick.
In addition, forthcoming political events are causing uncertainty for the pound.
Mr Derrick points to ""potential stumbling blocks along the way for sterling"".  He highlights the start of the next round of negotiations between the UK and the EU over Brexit, and the Conservative party conference, among other things.
However, he is unwilling to stick his neck out and predict whether and when the pound and euro will reach parity.
He concedes it's ""possible"" the pound could reach 1.05 to 1.06 euros  before the end of the year.
Take a look online at some of the currency exchanges. At the moment, travellers can get about 1.0600 to 1.0836 euros for their pound, depending on how much you're changing and who you're doing it with.
But if the predictions are correct that the exchange rate is going to get worse for Brits, then those deals might start to seem quite attractive.",The holiday season is in full swing.,40896987
669,"Charbonnier, known as ""Charb"", was 47. He had received death threats in the past and had been under police protection.
Reports say he was in an editorial meeting with the others when two masked gunmen burst in and opened fire with Kalashnikov assault rifles. The gunmen reportedly shouted ""Allahu akbar!"" (God is great).
The left-wing magazine's famous cartoonists went by nicknames - the others who died were called Cabu, Tignous and Wolinski.
Charb had strongly defended Charlie Hebdo's cartoons featuring the Prophet Muhammad.
""Muhammad isn't sacred to me,'' he told the Associated Press in 2012, after the magazine's offices had been fire-bombed.
""I don't blame Muslims for not laughing at our drawings. I live under French law. I don't live under Koranic law.""
In 2007 Charlie Hebdo also defended itself in court over cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad, reprinted in the magazine, which had angered Muslims.

670,"Ofsted inspectors warn this could leave them vulnerable to sexual exploitation.
Too few teachers have the expertise to discuss delicate issues such as sexuality and domestic violence, they say.
The warning comes after teaching unions raised concerns about the effects of a sexualised culture on pupils.
At unions' conferences over the Easter holidays, teachers shared their concerns about the negative impact pornography and pressure to have ""the perfect body"" was having on their pupils and called for better training to help teachers to deal with such issues.
In a report examining personal, social, health and economic (PSHE) education, Ofsted found it was good or outstanding in 60% of schools, but requiring improvement or inadequate in 40%.
In primary schools, the report says, too much emphasis is placed on friendships and relationships when teaching sex-and-relationships education and this can leave pupils ill-prepared for the physical and emotional changes of puberty.
And in secondary schools, too much emphasis is placed on the ""mechanics"" of reproduction rather than the importance of healthy sexual relationships.
The report says: ""A lack of high-quality, age-appropriate sex-and-relationships education in more than a third of schools is a concern as it may leave children and young people vulnerable to inappropriate sexual behaviours and sexual exploitation.
""This is because they have not been taught the appropriate language or developed the confidence to describe unwanted behaviours or know where to go to for help.""
Ofsted found that most secondary schools cover topics such as puberty, reproduction, sexually transmitted infections, contraception, abortion and pregnancy in PSHE lessons, but there was ""less emphasis on sexual consent and the influence of pornography.""
""The failure to include discussion of pornography is concerning as research shows that children as young as nine are increasingly accessing pornographic internet sites, and ChildLine counsellors have confirmed an increase to more than 50 calls a month from teenagers upset by pornography,"" the report says.
The report calls for better training for those teaching PSHE, particularly over ""sensitive issues"".
""Too many teachers lacked expertise in teaching sensitive and controversial issues, which resulted in some topics such as sexuality, mental health and domestic violence being omitted from the curriculum,"" it says.
""This was because subject-specific training and support were too often inadequate.
""In 20% of schools, staff had received little or no training to teach PSHE education. Teaching was not good in any of these schools.""
Ofsted's report found the development of pupils' personal and social skills was good or outstanding in 42 of the 50 schools inspected, but in the weaker schools ""casual use of homophobic and disablist language was commonplace"".
""In just under half of the schools, pupils learnt how to keep themselves safe in a variety of situations but not all had practised negotiating risky situations or applied security settings to social-networking sites,"" the report says.
In March, Education Minister Liz Truss announced  PSHE would remain a non-compulsory subject, saying it should be down to schools and teachers to decide on the topics covered in lessons. Sex and relationships education is, however, compulsory.
PSHE Association chief executive Joe Hayman said the report  painted a realistic picture of provision across the country.
""The reality is that while there is outstanding practice in many schools, far too many teachers go into PSHE lessons ill-equipped to deal with the extremely important and challenging issues the subject covers.
""It is obvious from the report that teachers need more help than they are currently getting and as a result many pupils do not get the high quality PSHE education they deserve.""
A Department for Education spokesman said: ""The quality of PSHE teaching is not good enough.
""Our curriculum reforms have given teachers the freedom to tailor their teaching so it meets the needs of their pupils.
""We are funding the PSHE Association to work with schools to develop curricula and improve the way it is taught.
""The best people to fix this problem are teachers on the ground - not politicians in Westminster.""
The findings of the Ofsted report were based on inspections of 24 primary, 24 secondary and two special schools between January and July 2012.","More than a third of schools in England are failing to provide pupils with age-appropriate sex-and-relationships education, the schools watchdog says.",22366107
671,"The Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper said air strikes had been used in the response to the flare-up in Shan state, near the Chinese border.
The BBC's Myanmar correspondent, Jonah Fisher, says it is the heaviest fighting in at least two years.
It comes as the government tries to sign a peace deal with rebel groups.
There are reports that thousands of people have been leaving the area to escape the fighting.
China said on Tuesday that some people had crossed over into its southern Yunnan province, and that they were being looked after.
Analysis: Jonah Fisher, Myanmar correspondent
The Kokang are a Han Chinese ethnic group, and their armed wing a remnant of the Burmese Communist Party which fragmented in 1989.
For years they have run a largely autonomous strip of land on Myanmar's north-eastern border with China.
This dramatic upsurge in fighting appears to have been triggered by the return of one of their leaders - Phone Kya Shin - from five years of exile in China.
In 2009, Phone Kya Shin was forced to flee by Burmese troops - but he has now returned promising to restore the rights of the Kokang people.
The newspaper said there had been at least 13 separate clashes in the area in recent days with the Kokang rebels, known as the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA).
Rebels attacked army bases close to Laukai, capital of the Kokang area of Shan state, it said. At least 47 soldiers were killed and more than 70 injured.
The report did not indicate any rebel casualty figures, but the Irrawaddy newspaper, based in Thailand, quoted the general secretary of MNDAA as saying two rebels had died and one was injured.
Htun Myat Lin said up to 10,000 people had fled as the military carried out air strikes using jets and helicopters.
Myanmar has been trying for decades to contain conflicts involving ethnic rebel movements seeking greater autonomy, largely in Shan and Kachin states.
President Thein Sein has been pushing for peace deals with these groups, and while many have come into the political fold sporadic outbreaks of violence have continued.
On Thursday, he held talks with the leaders of about a dozen armed groups in the capital, Nay Pyi Taw, including the MNDAA.
But they ended with no deal reached beyond a commitment to negotiate further.","Nearly 50 soldiers have been killed in a week of fighting between government troops and Kokang ethnic rebels in Myanmar, state media report.",31450420

And they are still seeking a replacement for Ash Taylor, the central defender who joined Northampton Town.
""Both Mark Reynolds and Anthony will see it as a real opportunity to get ahead of others,"" said McInnes.
Aberdeen had space for one ""wild card"" signing ahead of the first leg of the second qualifying round tie at Pittodrie, but that has been confirmed as winger Gary Mackay-Steven from Celtic.
O'Connor arrived from Burton Albion last summer and McInnes admits that the 24-year-old ""was possibly disappointed"" that many of his 40 appearances were not in his favoured position in central defence.
""It is clear I've been trying to bring in another defender because we are light in those areas,"" said the manager.
""But I'm confident we've got the experience and the understanding between the back four that we've got here.
""We will be signing another defender, but Shay Logan and Andrew Considine have been my full-backs for the last few years now and I'm comfortable we've got the experience, ability and understanding there to stop their threat.""
Logan, who signed after leaving Brentford in 2014, this week agreed a three-year contract extension, with McInnes revealing that the £1.3m received from Celtic for winger Jonny Hayes helped smooth the negotiations with the right-back and goalkeeper Joe Lewis.
""We said when we lost Jonny it was important that we used the money wisely and important to try to reinvest into the squad and to identify resigning players currently with us,"" said the manager.
""By and large, I've been really pleased with what the new players have gave us and delighted to get Shay and Joe Lewis signed for longer.""
While Republic of Ireland winger Hayes had gone in the other direction and Northern Ireland forward Niall McGinn had also opted to leave, midfielder Greg Tansey has arrived from Inverness Caledonian Thistle, while strikers Nicky Maynard and Greg Stewart have been recruited from MK Dons and Birmingham City respectively.
Celtic midfielder Ryan Christie has also stuck around for a second season on loan and Logan, speaking before the arrival of Mackay-Steven was confirmed, revealed he was also pleased with the way the squad is shaping up.
""I am more than happy with the games we've had and we go into this game confident and hopefully progress to the next round,"" added the 29-year-old while admitting he does not know very much about the Bosnian visitors.
""It is a division that not many people probably watch, but we've had a few scouts at games and watched a few videos, but we won't know more until we play them.
""Hopefully we can get a good result and hopefully know more about them going to their ground.

The Met Police is compiling a report for the Crown Prosecution Service a pre-inquest review at St Pancras Coroner's Court heard.
A spokesman for the council said such a charge was ""not appropriate"".
About an hour after Alexia's accident, on 17 July, she went into cardiac arrest and died in the Royal London hospital.
At the time, her mother Vida Kwotuah said she watched in horror as the tree trunk - which she described as rotten - knocking her daughter to the ground.
Det Insp Craig Bradley said more expert evidence was being gathered.
He said: ""We are in the process of investigating the possibility of corporate manslaughter or gross negligence. We have liaised very closely with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).""
The inquest heard the tree trunk was decayed and an expert has compiled a report on its state.
Mr Bradley said he has contacted another expert about the level of decay in the trunk at the time of the accident, and whether it would have been visible in an inspection.
Mark Scoggins at Fisher Scoggin Waters, solicitors representing Tower Hamlets Council, said such a charge would require ""gross failings"" in senior management at a ""very serious level"".

He was arrested at Heathrow airport on 9 October and appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Wednesday.

680,"There have been 68 recorded cases of wild poliovirus so far in 2014.  Last year there were 417 cases.
Contrast that with the one million children under five who die from pneumonia each year or the 750,000 who die from diarrhoeal disease.
Like polio, most of those deaths are vaccine-preventable.
The only previous threat to have been accorded the same status by the WHO was the H1N1 swine flu pandemic in 2009.
The reason for the WHO declaration is the risk that the goal of polio eradication may be not be achieved.
Billions of dollars are spent each year on polio immunisation and the number of cases has plummeted since the late 1980s.
There have been important milestones:  it is more than three years since the last polio case in India.
While the wild poliovirus continues to circulate, mass immunisations must continue in every country in the world.
If the disease was wiped out - like smallpox in the 1970s - then the money spent on polio immunisation could eventually be targeted elsewhere.
The declaration of a ""public health emergency of international concern"" is a measure of the potential threat to the eradication efforts.
The WHO wants all residents and long-term visitors to Pakistan, Cameroon and Syria to have been recently immunised and carry a certificate of vaccination.
All three countries have spread the virus across their borders this year during what is usually a low transmission season.
The virus has a higher risk of transmission during May and June.
There are several other countries infected with wild poliovirus which have not exported the disease - Nigeria, Afghanistan, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Iraq and Somalia.
The virus - which is shed in faeces - can spread rapidly from just one infected individual.
Most people who carry the virus show no symptoms, making it a very difficult disease to wipe out.
That is why it is so important that polio immunisation levels are maintained while the virus continues to circulate.
Polio eradication would be a huge achievement.  A target date of 2018 has been set - but previous deadlines have come and gone.
The next six months may show whether that goal really is a realistic target.",At first glance it might seem odd for the spread of polio to be declared an international public health emergency.,27295888

He was also known for numerous portrayals of Winston Churchill.
In more recent years, he appeared as Cornelius Fudge, the Minister for Magic, in four of the Harry Potter films.
His family said: ""Gruff, elegant, twinkly, and always dignified, he is celebrated by all who knew him and loved him, and everyone who enjoyed his work.""
His children Emma, Justine and Paul said in the statement: ""Dad is also remembered as a meticulous linguist, a fine artist, a lover of music and a champion of literature, as well a highly respected historian, and a leading specialist on the longbow.
""He was an essential part of the team that raised the great Tudor warship The Mary Rose.""
With his instantly recognisable voice and British bulldog manner, Robert Hardy enjoyed a distinguished acting career which spanned seven decades.
By the time he endeared himself to television audiences in the BBC's All Creatures Great and Small, he had already carved out a reputation as one of Britain's most versatile actors.
While his earlier career gave him a firm grounding in the theatre his best known roles were in front of the camera - particularly in television, a medium he obviously enjoyed.
Hardy, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, started his acting career at the age of 24 with the Shakespeare Memorial Company in Stratford, later the Royal Shakespeare Company, starring in a stage adaptation of Coriolanus.

One of Hardy's earliest TV roles was portraying Cassio in Othello in 1955.
He went on to become a household name in the BBC's All Creatures Great and Small, which ran for 12 years, in which he played senior vet Siegfried Farnon.
Co-star Christopher Timothy remembered him on Thursday as a ""fascinating"" actor who had been ""a joy to work with"".
""He didn't suffer fools so he was sometimes quite tricky,"" he told Radio 4's PM programme. ""But I was most grateful for his experience, confidence, wit and style.""
Timothy said he had last seen Hardy 18 months ago and found him ""frail, yet still sparkly and twinkly.""

Other TV roles included Arthur Brooke in Middlemarch in 1994 and Tite Barnacle in Little Dorrit in 2008.
On the big screen he was seen in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and 1995's Sense and Sensibility.
He played Churchill several times, including in Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years, for which he won a Bafta in 1982.
He portrayed the wartime prime minister for preview performances of The Audience, alongside Dame Helen Mirren, in 2013 before withdrawing from the role.
Most recently, he took the lead role in Winston Churchill: 100 Days That Saved Britain in 2015.

The gold-encrusted pistols feature Napoleonic symbols such as the imperial eagle and the iron crown of Italy.
Napoleon was defeated in battle and sent into exile on Elba island soon after they were given.
""These remarkable treasures epitomise the greatest personal tragedy of Napoleon's life, that he saw his beloved son and heir for the last time in January 1814, destroying his hopes to create a lasting dynasty,"" said Christopher Mason, a specialist in European sculpture and works of art from Sotheby's.

A combination of issues, such as the EU referendum and lower public engagement, could mean fewer people bother to cast a vote on 5 May, he said.
The lowest assembly election turnout was 38.2% in 2003.
Speaking to BBC Wales after making a speech in Cardiff highlighting his fears about public interest in the poll, Mr Davies said there was a risk turnout could fall below the 2003 figure.
""Because all elections carry that risk, and I very much hope that instead of having a low turnout we have a record turnout because the issues which are most important to most people in this country; health, education, the economy, local authorities and the environment are all determined from the assembly,"" he said.
""So I hope we don't see it, but I think there is a risk that could happen.""
He also said politicians had to ""go the extra mile"" over the last thirteen days of the election campaign to get more coverage.
In his speech, Mr Davies said there was little evidence voters were getting the information they needed, accusing parts of the media of being more interested in politicians' tax returns than analysing policies on the NHS, education or local councils.
Political leaders, including Mr Davies, published their tax returns earlier this month in response to questions about Prime Minister David Cameron's income.
Mr Davies re-iterated a pledge to introduce a Localism and Citizenship Bill within 100 days of a Welsh Conservative government taking power.
The bill would give communities the right to buy local assets, such as pubs or post offices, and give more powers to local councils.
Roles including the Older People's Commissioner, the Children's Commissioner and the Future Generations Commissioner would be answerable to all AMs, not the Welsh Government, he added.
In its first 100 days, a Welsh Tory government would also sell off ministerial cars, publish details of Welsh Government spending and ensure an entire Welsh Government department is re-located to north Wales.
At the previous assembly election, in 2011, the Conservatives finished second, winning 14 of the 60 seats.
A UKIP spokesman said: ""Low turnout is becoming increasingly problematic across a range of elections with the Welsh assembly elections being no different.""
He said there was a ""sense of disenfranchisement"" because people were ""confused as to who does what and where and how they can have their voices heard"".

First time offenders who cause less serious injuries could face fines or community service rather than prison, under the plans.
But campaigners said the bill would mean the ""exoneration of tyrants in the home"".
MPs voted 358 to two in favour of the proposals, with one abstention. The bill, dubbed the ""slapping law"" by some Russian media outlets, will now have a third reading.
It will also need the approval of the upper house and President Vladimir Putin before becoming law.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was important to distinguish between ""family relations"" and repeated incidents of violence.
The bill was introduced by MP Yelena Mizulina, a highly conservative lawmaker, in July after a change in the criminal code made beating a family member a criminal offence.
Conservatives feared that the decision would mean parents could be prosecuted for disciplining their children.
Under the proposals, a first offence would be prosecuted under civil rather than criminal law. Subsequent incidents could still be considered criminal offences and carry potential jail terms.
Andrei Isayev, an MP for President Putin's United Russia party, told the Associated Press: ""This is a historic vote because in certain countries the state's role in family life is way too much. Today's vote will end such practices in the Russian Federation.""

Maria Mokhova, executive director of the ""Sisters"" crisis centre for abuse victims, told Reuters: ""This law calls for the exoneration of tyrants in the home.
""The message is: 'Let's not punish a person who at home beat up his family, just because he has the right to do that.'""
Official data on domestic violence in Russia is very limited, but estimates based on regional studies suggest that each year 600,000 women face physical and verbal abuse in the home and 14,000 die from injuries inflicted by their husbands or partners.
Women rights activist Alena Popova ridiculed the bill in a tweet: ""The authorities see only benefits behind domestic violence: 1. Many won't live until retirement age; 2. People will be busy with self-destruction and will not criticise the authorities.""
Ms Popova's petition calling for comprehensive legislation against domestic violence has reached more than 225,000 signatures.
Some social media users made light of the law. ""Boxing in the kitchen is now legalised,"" one VKontakte post said.
But other men spoke directly against the plans. ""It is not a laughing matter. Domestic violence will flourish. I consider this bill anti-national,"" another VKontakte user wrote.
""I feel shame for such a Duma. Punishment for family violence should be harsher. No-one has the right to raise their hand against a human, a living being,"" said a woman on Facebook.",A Russian bill to decriminalise some forms of domestic violence has moved a step closer to becoming law.,38745827
686,"Bridgend council wants to limit kerbside rubbish collections to save money and hit Welsh government targets.
There are currently no restrictions on the number of black bags each household can put out.
A council spokeswoman said it was exploring use of different colour bags to show if the rules had been broken.
The changes, which will also include the start of a nappy and sanitary item disposal service, will be introduced in April 2017.
Councillors will discuss the changes during a meeting of the cabinet on Tuesday when the new seven year contract for waste collection will be awarded.
A report by the council in March said it was predicted to fall short of the Welsh government 58% target for recycling - meaning it could be fined at Â£200 per tonne.
The two bag restriction would mean it reaches 64% by 2019-2020, it predicted.
Under the new system the council may issue a roll of specifically branded bags to each household, at the cost of about Â£147,300 a year.
Residents who break the rules could have their waste left at the kerbside, their addresses could be recorded and they may be visited at home.",Residents in Bridgend county borough will only be able to throw away two black bin bags of household rubbish a fortnight under council changes.,37826992

Rowe, 27, concedes his lay-off might be even longer than a year.
""It was a freak accident. It wasn't like I was swinging from the roof tops drunk, but there is only one person to blame,"" Rowe told BBC Wales Sport.
Rowe, Team Sky's road captain, broke a rib in a crash on the opening stage of this year's Tour de France but rode on to help Chris Froome win the title.
Rowe, who says he has no regrets about attending his brother's stag-do, jumped into a shallow section of water while rafting and landed on rocks.
I knew straight away how serious it was, it was excruciating pain and there are quite a few broken bones. It was a case of trying to get out of the water as quickly as possible and into an ambulance.
I've broken a fair few bones in my career but this was significantly worse than any of them. It was double the pain - add the pain of a few broken bones together.
I lifted my leg, but my foot stayed still, it was kind of hanging off, limp. The bone didn't break the skin, but it is pretty scary when you look down and see that when you are on the side of a riverbank.
It was a freak accident but it was a mistake. The water clearly wasn't deep enough to jump into, but hindsight is a beautiful thing. Other people were jumping with no problems, but I hit a rock.
I knew straight away the implications of what I had done and how long it would take to come back.
Rowe told Team Sky he was going on the stag-do and they flew a doctor out to Prague to immediately accompany him back to Cardiff for the first of what could be several surgeries.
The leg is in a bad way and recovery is a bit of an unknown at the moment. It will be a long road back but I won't back down and I want to get back to where I was.
Some people react to the operations and treatment really well but it is hard to predict a race, a point in the season or even a year when I will be able to come back.
I've been asking the doctors time and time again. When can I train? When can I walk? When can I get back on a bike?
The first questions I asked were for dates because you get impatient. But essentially the doctors are all telling me the same thing. We do know that operation by operation, scan by scan, it will get better. But the timescale? We just don't know that.
It's a moment in your career where your back is against the wall and you really need to roll your sleeves up. It's going to be a tough few months for me and it could be up to 9-12 months - that's realistic.
I have to live my life. I'll be on crutches at my brother's wedding in seven weeks' time and I don't think I will be spending much time on the dance floor.""","Team Sky's Luke Rowe says he ""could be out for up to a year"" after breaking his right leg while white-water rafting on his brother's stag party in Prague.",40874578

Peadar Heffron was seriously injured by a dissident republican bomb in 2010.
Repeated requests for intelligence did not get any meaningful response, the Police Ombudsman's report said.
It recommended that four intelligence officers should receive written warnings for not providing the information requested by the detectives.
However, the PSNI disagreed and imposed a lower level of sanction on two of them.
Chief Constable George Hamilton and his deputy, Drew Harris, met Policing Board members in a private session on Tuesday to discuss the report and their response.
Afterwards, Policing Board Chair Anne Connolly said there had been a ""full and frank discussion"" between the board and the chief constable.
""The chief constable has been asked by the board to consider if there are any further measures that now need to be taken on the back of the report, and the board has also asked its human rights adviser to conduct a review of arrangements,"" she said.
She said board members had sought assurances about the support being provided to Mr Heffron, ""and very much welcome that he has now received an apology from the PSNI"".

Critics said it showed the EU's wastefulness, at a time when it was arguing for a budget increase.
Court President Vitor Caldeira said: ""With Europe's public finances under severe pressure, there remains scope to spend EU money more efficiently.""
He added: ""Member states must agree on better rules for how EU money is spent, and member states and the commission must enforce them properly.""
The court's report said most errors arose from ""misapplication or misunderstanding"" of the EU's complex rules, though there were some suspected cases of fraud.
It also said the failures were often down to the national and local governments responsible for overseeing the distribution of funds, rather than just the European Commission.
""A little more effort by member states to control projects properly and retrieve misused funds could go a long way, particularly in this time of economic difficulty,"" said the EU's Audit Commissioner Algirdas Semeta.
However, critics said the commission itself must also accept some of the blame.

""The family have a proven track record of building successful teams on the field, and balancing the books off it.""

""The children all loved her and they're a great judge of character,"" said Dr Ruth Glynne-Owen, Blue Sky Autism Project's founder and chief executive.
It was the charity's fourth birthday party and a special guest had arrived at their base in Bridge of Allan, near Stirling.
Perched among a throng of excited youngsters, Tara Palmer-Tomkinson started to play for the children on a small keyboard.
""There was no stand and it was held together by tape and she still played it - and she's a concert pianist,"" Dr Glynne-Owen said.
""Our children can be a little bit tricky to get to know given the nature of autism, but she was totally not phased.
""It was very cool, it was a great day.""
The star was immediately keen to offer her support when the charity, which provides early childhood intervention for pre-school children with autism spectrum disorders and related conditions, approached her in 2013.
Dr Glynne-Owen said: ""She got back in touch straight away and she phoned me and was really keen to help.
""When I first met her, we had a cup of tea at Blakes Hotel in Kensington and I was very nervous.
""I brought her a little teddy bear and she was very incredibly touched by that.

Dr McWhinnie was a renowned social researcher in assisted conception at Dundee University until her retirement.
At Dundee Sheriff Court, Burns admitted two charges of theft between 15 November and 14 December last year and will be sentenced next month.
Burns targeted Dr McWhinnie - who received an MBE from Prince Charles for her work - after she gave Burns her bank card and PIN number to withdraw cash on her behalf.
Dr McWhinnie told the court: ""If you can't trust the people who look after you, then who can you trust?""
Fiscal depute John Adams told the court: ""The complainer is a 91-year-old female whose family employs care services to assist her.

""I feel a mix [of Welsh and Italian]. I was born in Wales so I grew up Welsh but the more I learned about my heritage, the more I also felt Italian,"" Vitalini told BBC Radio Wales.
""When I was playing rugby at a young age, my grandparents were a huge influence on me and they were always so passionate about me possibly playing for Italy one day.""
Vitalini's grandparents met in Wales after emigrating separately when they were teenagers and later opened a family shop in Newport.
""Unfortunately they passed away several years ago, which is getting to me, because they never got to see me or know that I played for Italy and that's something to be proud of,"" he continued.

700,"Tom Hayes allegedly told one trader that he had managed to keep the three-month Libor rate ""artificially high"".
Mr Hayes, 35, a former UBS and Citigroup trader, is facing eight counts of conspiracy to defraud.
He denies the charges.
Mr Hayes is accused of acting in ""a thoroughly dishonest manner"" in his alleged attempts to rig the benchmark rate.
On the second day of the trial, the jury was presented with electronic and audio conversations between Mr Hayes and fellow traders.
In one of the electronic conversations submitted to the jury, Mr Hayes is allegedly discussing manipulating the Libor rate with Will Hall, a trader at RBS, in February 2007.
Mr Hayes said: ""Three-month Libor is too high, 'cos I've kept it artificially high.""
He said he had managed to do this by ""being mates with the cash desks - [JP Morgan] Chase and I always help each other out"".
Prosecuting QC Mukul Chawla QC said: ""If you ever needed any evidence of deliberate rigging of rates, this is it.
""This is strategic, isn't it. It's nothing to do with the bank's borrowing rates. It's all to do with Mr Hayes' trading positions.""
The jury was also played a short telephone conversation between Mr Hayes and his stepbrother, Peter O'Leary, who had recently joined the bank HSBC.
In the conversation, Mr Hayes can be heard asking Mr O'Leary to persuade the HSBC person submitting the yen Libor rate to keep it ""on the low side"" for a few days.
This would allegedly help with Mr Hayes' trading positions.
In another exchange with a trader at a different bank, Mr Hayes allegedly wrote: ""Do me a huge favour and ask the cash guys to set one-month Libor low for the next few days. I will return the favour.""
Mr Chawla said this was evidence of a culture of ""you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours"" that Mr Hayes developed with other banks.
On Tuesday, Mr Chawla accused Mr Hayes, a former UBS and Citigroup trader, of being motivated by ""greed"" and acting as the ""ringmaster"" in an enormous fraud to rig the benchmark interest rate.
Libor - the London Interbank Offered Rate - is an interest rate used by banks around the world to set the price of financial products worth trillions of pounds.

701,"Wednesday's Autumn Statement for the first time showed how it is cutting into the government tax take.
The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimates that in 2020/21 it will cost the Treasury £3.5bn.
Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond said he would find more effective ways to tax workers in the shifting labour environment.
""Technological progress is changing the way people live, and the way they work,"" he said. ""The tax system needs to keep pace.""
But the Association of Independent Professionals and the Self Employed (IPSE) said the government is ignoring the importance of the self-employed sector.
Andy Chamberlain, deputy director of policy at IPSE, said: ""The chancellor boasted about record low unemployment, scoring political points, but failed to mention that the huge rise in self-employment is the main thing that allows him to make that claim.""
MPs Frank Field and Andrew Forsey, in their report Wild West Work, published in September, said that out of those 2.6 million people who have found a new job since 2010, more than a third have been classed as self-employed.
Mr Hammond also said that he could claw back some £630m over the next five years from self-employed workers who are not paying tax on so-called ""disguised earnings"", payments made as, for example, a loan or a payment in kind.
Mr Chamberlain said he ""wholeheartedly supported"" any measure to stop any scheme deliberately designed to avoid paying tax.
But he added: ""The loss in tax revenue for the government is not because self-employed workers are paying much less. The real differential is because the employer is no longer paying National Insurance Contributions (NIC).
""If you employ someone for £100,000, you pay the taxman about £13,000 in NIC. If you pay a self-employed person the same amount, the government loses that tax revenue.""

Mr Hammond also said the government was losing revenue from ""incorporation"", the process by which individuals form a company, often with themselves as the only employee, to pay less tax.
By doing so, instead of just taking a salary and paying income tax, they can also get much of their earnings as dividends from their corporate profits.
Even though the tax on dividends has risen, for most people it is still lower than income tax.
And for the Treasury that means less tax revenue.
The chancellor said in the Autumn Statement he would ""consult in due course on any proposed changes"".
Mr Chamberlain said: ""The reason self-employed workers become incorporated is not just to do with tax. It's also to do with the security of having limited liability.
""And clients often insist upon it if they want to have a business-to-business relationship. This whole area of work is changing faster than the government can keep up with.
""For instance the ruling on the Uber drivers last month that established that they were workers, employed by Uber, gives them some statutory rights. But it doesn't effect their tax status, which is still one of self-employed.""
Mr Chamberlain added: ""The government is now beginning to wonder if it really has the systems in place to capture all the different ways of working.""","The UK's ""gig economy"", powered by self-employment and casual work, is starting to hit government revenues.",38082535
702,"Mr Spicer is reportedly stepping down because he is unhappy with President Donald Trump's appointment of a new communications director.
But he told Fox News he had ""no regrets"" about his six-month stint.
Wall Street financier Anthony Scaramucci has been picked for the role that Mr Spicer had partially filled.
The shake-up at the White House comes amid several investigations into alleged Russian meddling in last year's US presidential election and whether Mr Trump's campaign team colluded with Moscow.
""The president obviously wanted to add to the team, more than anything,"" Mr Spicer told interviewer Sean Hannity.
""I just thought it was in the best interest of our communications department, of our press organisation, to not have too many cooks in the kitchen.
""Without me in the way, they have a fresh start, so that I'm not lurking over them.""
He defended President Trump's agenda, saying it was an honour and a privilege to serve him, and hit out at what he termed ""media bias"".
He said: ""I was increasingly disappointed about the way the media here do their job - or don't do their job.""
The 45 year old also said he had told Mr Trump he ""would stay on for a few weeks to achieve a smooth transition"", and was looking forward to spending more time with his family.
President Trump tweeted: ""Sean Spicer is a wonderful person who took tremendous abuse from the Fake News Media - but his future is bright!""
The New York Times reported that Mr Spicer had ""vehemently"" disagreed with the appointment of Mr Scaramucci, which he believed to be a ""major mistake"".
Mr Spicer's often chaotic press briefings over the past six months were a cable news hit, but in recent weeks he had withdrawn from appearances in front of the camera.
In an assured debut, he attended Friday afternoon's news conference to announce that Sarah Huckabee Sanders, formerly Mr Spicer's deputy, would step into his shoes.
""I love the president and it's an honour to be here,"" Mr Scaramucci said, adding: ""He is genuinely a wonderful human being.""
Mr Scaramucci, who has no previous experience in communications roles, paid tribute to Mr Spicer as ""a true American patriot"" and ""incredibly gracious"".
""I hope he goes on to make a tremendous amount of money,"" he added.
Mr Scaramucci also apologised and said he had been ""unexperienced"" as he explained his previous criticism of the president.
In an August 2015 interview with Fox Business, he dismissed Mr Trump as a ""hack"" and ""an inherited money dude"" with ""a big mouth"".
Mr Scaramucci is currently senior vice-president of the Export-Import Bank, a US government agency which guarantees loans for foreign buyers of American exports.
A former member of the Trump transition team, he mistakenly suggested to the BBC in January that Elton John would play at the new president's inauguration. The singer promptly denied it.
Life on a White House staff is intense and exhausting.
This administration is under particular pressure, given the ongoing Russia investigation, recent legislative setbacks and a president who can be, shall we say, occasionally off-message. Now cracks in the structure are beginning to show.
Sean Spicer's departure, reportedly because he doesn't want to work for newly named communication director Anthony Scaramucci, represents the most significant shakeup within the administration's senior team to date. It could also be a sign of bigger tremors to come.
Mr Spicer was closely allied with White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, who was his boss last year in the Republican National Committee.
The Trump team has been rife with personal feuds, as various factions vie for a mercurial president's ear. Leaks abound.
The prestige and power of advisers and aides wax and wane. Media reports abound of a White House under siege.
And just a reminder - the Trump presidency is only six months old.
On day one in January, Mr Spicer set the tone of his relationship with the press by bursting into the briefing room to berate journalists for their reporting of crowd numbers at President Trump's inauguration.
His proclivity for gaffes and garbling of his words, as well as making debatable assertions, soon made Mr Spicer a household name.
But he could also be charming and was liked by many among the press corps.
Mr Spicer was lampooned on topical comedy show Saturday Night Live, where Melissa McCarthy played him as a loud-mouthed bully who brandished his lectern at reporters.
Mr Trump noted approvingly in April that Mr Spicer ""gets great ratings"". A month later, the president said: ""He's doing a good job but he gets beat up.""

703,"Posters were put up around Knettishall Heath in Suffolk on 1 April, claiming work was ongoing to reintroduce wolves.
Suffolk Wildlife Trust said it had received messages of concern ""amid continuing coverage"" on spoof sites.
""Just to be clear, there are no plans to introduce wolves anywhere in Suffolk,"" a park ranger said.
It is not known who was behind the hoax.

The realistic-looking signs, which advised visitors to carry flare guns and not to enter the heath after dark, were removed by rangers as soon as they were spotted.
The hoax claimed the wildlife trust was working in partnership with the UK Wolf Conservation Trust to reintroduce a pack of wolves to the site by the end of the month.
Ranger Sam Norris said the heath was an ""ancient place"" which the trust was ""delighted"" to be restoring ""to the kind of wild landscape that our Bronze Age ancestors would have recognised"".
""However, I can categorically say that this definitely does not involve re-introducing wolves,"" she added.

708,"The Crime Survey for England and Wales indicates overall crime has fallen in recent years, but the Wales-only figures show there has been a rise.
The survey reported 469,000 incidents in Wales, up from 401,000 in 2011.
Most of the increase in Wales happened in the past year and has been driven by a hike in the number of violent crimes.
The Crime Survey for England and Wales is a survey of households conducted by the Office for National Statistics, which asks people if they have been a victim of crime.
This picks up many crimes that are not reported to the police.
The figures fluctuate from year to year but in recent years more people in Wales, according to the crime survey, have been a victim of crime.
Despite the increase, the recent level of crime is half that experienced 20 years ago, when in 1995 there were 903,000 incidents.
Last month, the latest data for England and Wales combined showed a 16% fall in crime compared with the previous year's survey, representing the lowest estimate since the survey began in 1981.
The other main source of official crime statistics is the data collected by police forces on the number of recorded crimes.
According to this measure, the number of crimes reported to the police in Wales was 175,888 in the year to June 2014 - up 1.3% from 173,614 a year earlier.
The reliability of police recorded crime figures were questioned in a parliamentary inquiry earlier this year.
In response to the figures, a Home Office spokesman said the survey sample was not designed for regional level analysis.
""The change in the year ending March 2014 Crime Survey figure for Wales (compared with a year earlier) is not statistically significant,"" he said.
""Because of the small sample size at a regional level, changes in regional figures derived from the survey can be volatile from one year to the next meaning it is difficult to interpret trends.""","Crime in Wales has gone up by 17% over the past four years, official figures seen by BBC Wales suggest.",30020657
709,"Passengers from at-risk countries will have their temperature taken, complete a risk questionnaire and have contact details recorded.
Mr Hunt said screening at Gatwick and Eurostar terminals would start in the coming week.
The Chief Medical Officer says the risk to the UK is low, but expects a ""handful"" of cases.
Mr Hunt said it was ""genuinely very difficult"" to predict an exact number of cases, but said the expected figure for the next three months was not in double figures.
In September, around 1,000 people arrived in the UK from Ebola-affected countries in West Africa.
Screening at Heathrow Terminal 1 will begin on Tuesday, before being extended to other terminals at the airport as well as Gatwick and Eurostar. The Department of Health estimates that 85% of all arrivals to the UK from affected countries will come through Heathrow.
Border Force officers will identify passengers to be screened. Nurses and consultants from Public Health England will carry out the testing.
Anyone with suspected Ebola will be taken to hospital.
Passengers deemed at high-risk due to contact with Ebola patients, but with no symptoms, will be contacted daily by Public Health England.
A spokesman for Heathrow said the welfare of ""our passengers and colleagues is always our main priority"".
He added: ""We would like to reassure passengers that the Government assesses the risk of a traveller contracting Ebola to be low.""
There is no direct flight from Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea so people could arrive at airports that do not screen passengers.
""Highly visible information"" will be in place at all entry points to the UK, Mr Hunt insisted.
Patients with suspected Ebola will be taken to hospital and blood sample will be taken to the Public Health England's specialist laboratory for rapid testing.
If the test is positive then the patient will be transferred to the specialist isolation unit at the Royal Free Hospital in London. It is the centre that cared for the British nurse William Pooley, who contracted Ebola in West Africa.
Hospitals in Newcastle, Liverpool and Sheffield are on standby to offer similar facilities if there is a sudden surge in Ebola cases. At total of 26 isolation beds could be prepared at the four hospitals.
Ebola has killed more than 4,000 people in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.
Mr Hunt said tackling the outbreak in Africa was the ""single most important way"" of preventing Ebola arriving in the UK.
He added: ""We should remember that the international community has shown that if we act decisively we can defeat serious new infectious disease threats such as Sars and pandemic flu.
""The situation will get worse before it gets better, but we should not flinch in our resolve to defeat Ebola both for the safety of the British population and as part of our responsibility to some of the poorest countries on the planet.""

The government had been arguing against screening last week, but there was a sudden change in policy.
Mr Hunt said the medical advice had changed and the UK was preparing for the situation deteriorating in West Africa.
He said: ""[The chief medical officer] confirms that the public health risk in the UK remains low and measures currently in place, including exit screening in all three affected countries, offer the correct level of protection.
""However whilst the response to global health emergencies should always be proportionate, she also advises the Government to make preparations for a possible increase in the risk level.""
Ebola symptoms: what to do in the UK?
Symptoms of Ebola include fever, headache, vomiting, diarrhoea, bleeding - but these are similar to more common infections like flu and some stomach bugs
If you have these symptoms and had contact with an Ebola patient then ring 111 first, do not go directly to A&E or a GP.
If there has been no contact with Ebola then seek help from 111, your GP or A&E if necessary.

711,"In an unusual move, Mr Bercow has put his name to a letter intended to put pressure on Chancellor George Osborne ahead of the Spending Review.
Two Conservative former cabinet ministers and two ex-Labour cabinet ministers have also signed it.
The Department for Education said per-pupil funding was being protected.
It said the government would continue to make ""funding fairer"".
The letter to the prime minister, seen by BBC Radio 4's PM programme, demands ""urgent action"" to change the funding system.
It says the current school funding rules are arbitrary and unfair and see the worst-funded areas receive on average Â£2,000 less per pupil than the best-funded each year.
It comes as the Institute for Fiscal Studies says despite a Conservative promise to raise school spending with student numbers, the amount spent per pupil is likely to fall by around 8%, taking into account inflation experienced by schools, by 2020.
The IFS says this will be the first time since the mid-1990s that school spending has fallen in real terms.
Rising wage costs and national insurance bills are putting school finances under pressure.
The PM programme has heard fears those pressures could see classes of 50 pupils in core subjects.
Conservative ministers have long promised to change the formula that dictates how much money schools get, but have not said when the change will come.
If delivered without extra funding it would see some schools lose money.
The Conservative former chair of the education select committee Graham Stuart admitted the reform would be ""enormously difficult politically"".
The government needed to come up with a plan that was fair and politically deliverable, he said.
He added: ""It's also about looking people in the eye and saying there is no rational basis for the additional funding that you receive compared to these other authorities.
""Therefore it is right and proper that your budget should be reduced.""
Many Conservatives regard a manifesto commitment to ""make schools funding fairer"" as vaguely-worded and fear ministers will offer only slight change, late in the Parliament.
As speaker, Mr Bercow is politically impartial but can deal with his constituents' problems like other MPs.
Other signatories to the letter, which will be sent to the prime minister, include former Tory cabinet ministers Caroline Spelman and Cheryl Gillan.
Former Labour cabinet ministers Ben Bradshaw and Andrew Smith have also signed.
Their letter demands ""urgent action"".
It says: ""It is widely acknowledged that the existing school funding model is a muddle and that funding for individual schools with similar pupil characteristics is arbitrary and unfair.""
Nick Binder, head of the Sele school in Hertford and chair of the Hertfordshire Association of Secondary School Headteachers, told PM some heads were looking at teaching two classes simultaneously.
The plan could see one teacher addressing 50 children, he said.
""I don't think parents have seen the impact yet and I think as they do they are going to be shocked,"" he said.
A spokesman for the Department for Education said: ""We are ensuring schools across England are funded fairly so all pupils, whatever their background and wherever they live in the country, have access to a good education.
""We have maintained per pupil funding and will make funding fairer.
""Despite the economic climate we have already committed an additional Â£390m to the least fairly-funded areas in the country.
""It is down to councils to determine exactly how funding is allocated to individual schools.""",Speaker John Bercow has joined more than 90 Conservative MPs demanding the government urgently rewrites the rules for funding schools in England.,34597047
712,"The reserves will cover 3.1 million sq km of ocean, including the Coral Sea.
Restrictions will be placed on fishing and oil and gas exploration in the protected zone covering more than a third of Australia's waters.
Environment Minister Tony Burke, who made the announcement, will attend the earth summit in Brazil next week with Prime Minister Julia Gillard.
""It's time for the world to turn a corner on protection of our oceans,"" Mr Burke said. ""And Australia today is leading that next step.""
Australia has timed its announcement to coincide with the run-up to the Rio+20 Earth Summit - a global gathering of leaders from more than 130 nations to discuss protecting key parts of the environment, including the ocean, says the BBC's Duncan Kennedy.
The plans, which have been years in the making, will proceed after a final consultation process.
Last year, the Australian government announced plans to protect the marine life in the Coral Sea - an area of nearly 1 million sq km.
The sea - off the Queensland coast in northeastern Australia - is home to sharks and tuna, isolated tropical reefs and deep sea canyons. It is also the resting place of three US navy ships sunk in the Battle of the Coral Sea in 1942.
The network of marine reserve will also include the Great Barrier Reef, a Unesco World Heritage site.
The plan will see the numbers of marine reserves off the Australian coast increased from 27 to 60.
""What we've done is effectively create a national parks estate in the ocean,'' Mr Burke told Australian media.
However, activists and environmental protection groups are likely to be less than satisfied with the plans, having called for a complete ban on commercial fishing in the  Coral Sea.
The fishing industry is set to receive hundreds of millions of dollars in compensation, reports say.
Some have also noted that oil and gas exploration continue to be allowed near some protected areas, particularly off western Australia.
The Australian Conservation Foundation said that although the plan didn't  go as far as they would like, it was  a major achievement in terms of ocean conservation.

715,"The downgrade could increase the airline's borrowing costs and sends a warning to investors.
The move by S&P comes after the airline issued a surprise profit warning and announced 1,000 job cuts on Thursday.
The carrier expects to make losses of up to A$300m ($271m; Â£165m) in the July-to-December period.
S&P said the rating cut reflected its view ""that intense competition in the airline industry has weakened Qantas' business risk profile to fair from satisfactory, and financial risk profile to significant from intermediate.""
It lowered the carrier's rating from the lowest investment grade, BBB-, to BB+.
Gareth Evans, chief financial officer of Qantas, said the downgrade was ""not unexpected"" and ""highlights the unprecedented pressures that the Qantas Group is facing from several external forces but particularly from an uneven playing field in the Australian aviation market"".
However, he added that Qantas ""retains a strong financial position, including a large cash balance and a significant asset base"".
The airline said in a statement that it had a cash balance of A$2.8bn as of 30 June 2013 and had reduced its debt by A$1bn in the last financial year.
Moody's rating agency warned on Thursday that it may also lower the Australian flag carrier's rating.
Qantas has been hurt by a range of factors in recent times including higher fuel costs, subdued global travel demand and increased competition.
The airline has claimed that its ownership rules, which limit total foreign holding of Qantas to 49%, with foreign airlines allowed to own just 35%, have further hurt its growth.
Qantas has argued that limits on its foreign ownership have benefited arch rival Virgin, which has attracted investment from foreign carriers Etihad, Singapore Airlines and Air New Zealand.
Last month, the airline backed a suggestion by Australian Treasurer Joe Hockey that these rules should be changed.
Qantas has also said it needs government action to help it compete more effectively.
Australia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott indicated that the government was unlikely to give Qantas any financial support.
The Australian Broadcasting Corporation quoted Mr Abbott as saying that Qantas had to ""get its house in order"".
""That's what has to happen,"" he said. ""If we subsidise Qantas, why not subsidise everyone?""
""And if we subsidise everyone, that's just a bottomless pit into which we will descend.""

716,"The Robins trailed to an early Peter Murphy strike before goals from Billy Waters and Harry Pell in quick succession gave the visitors a much-needed first league win since 22 October.
Morecambe got off to the perfect start with the opening goal after six minutes.
A poor clearance from Daniel O'Shaughnessy gave Rhys Turner a free run on goal and - although his shot from the edge of the box was saved by Russell Griffiths - the ball fell perfectly into the path of Peter Murphy, who slotted home from six yards out.
Paul Mullin then tested Griffiths again from distance before a poor game was given a spark when Morecambe midfielder Alex Kenyon was given a controversial red card after being fouled by Kyle Storer on 41 minutes. The decision happened right in front of home boss Jim Bentley who was so incensed that he was sent to the stands for his reaction.
Against the 10 men, the visitors forged their first opening of the game after 45 minutes when Harry Pell found Billy Waters, who turned smartly in the box but curled his effort wide of the right-hand post.
The second half saw the Robins dominate possession but they struggled to get past a stubborn home defence until Waters reacted sharply to stab home a loose ball from close range after the hosts failed to clear a right-wing corner.
Seconds later Cheltenham added a second when Waters turned creator with a pinpoint cross from the right that gave Pell a free header to score from close range.

717,"And now, to add to the intrigue, Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal is fighting to save his job after the home loss to Norwich City left him admitting he was worried about his future after six games without a win that also saw them eliminated from the Champions League.
So the pieces of world football's managerial jigsaw have been shaken in the box - where will they all fall into place?
Jose Mourinho
The 52-year-old Portuguese has long been linked with Old Trafford and was in the board's thoughts when Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013 but had already committed to a return to Chelsea.
Mourinho has the double appeal of being not only readily available but also having the status of Premier League title winner just seven months ago at Stamford Bridge.
The pragmatic style he employs may take some getting used to, or even tailoring at the 'Theatre of Dreams', but he is ready to return immediately and will have a point to prove after his Chelsea exit.
RATING (likelihood of it happening): 8/10.
Pep Guardiola
Media playback is not supported on this device
The most coveted coaching name in world football and available at the end of the season - it is almost inconceivable he will not have been discussed as United plan for the future. He was another considered when Ferguson left but he never returned their call.
The 44-year-old Spaniard, who won two Champions Leagues at Barcelona, would be the dream choice at Old Trafford - among many other places - but there is the lingering belief he is destined to join old Nou Camp cohorts Tziki Begiristain and Ferran Soriano at Manchester City.
United may still hold appeal but would the club make the call knowing they might end up looking like they have been snubbed for their neighbours?
RATING: 7
Louis van Gaal
Media playback is not supported on this device
Van Gaal, 64, was regarded as the man to bring stability and progress to the chaos left behind by the brief and dismal reign of David Moyes in succession to Ferguson.
The Dutchman also brought iron will and discipline. Van Gaal's first season, while not sparkling, could be considered a success as he restored United to the Premier League's top four and back to the Champions League.
Despite his spending in excess of £250m, Van Gaal has looked a manager out of time, seemingly at odds with his joyless players and increasingly receiving the ire of fans because of that toxic football combination of dull performances and bad results.
While the Champions League exit may not have delivered the fatal blow, poor league results and a general air of discontent around Old Trafford has put Van Gaal on the brink.
He will need a big turnaround to survive in the short-term and, despite United's best intentions, is unlikely to last the full term of his contract until the end of next season.
RATING: 5
Ryan Giggs
The continuity candidate and a graduate from Old Trafford's 'Class Of '92', Giggs has been the quietest second fiddle, sitting silently next to Van Gaal as his assistant but with the dictatorial Dutchman making all the calls.
The Welshman has long been touted as a future United manager, but is the 42-year-old - who made a record 963 appearances for the club, winning 13 titles, four FA Cups and two Champions Leagues among 34 trophies - up to the job?
Giggs might be the romantic choice of some United fans but he has no full-time managerial experience and no body of work to suggest he would be a success in this toughest and most demanding of environments.
Has he actually moved further away from the United manager's job than closer to it while sitting next to Van Gaal?
RATING: 6
VERDICT: Van Gaal is struggling and seemingly near the end of the line. Mourinho is available and letting it be known to all of the world's biggest clubs that he is awaiting the call? Mourinho to Manchester United is starting to look the next big managerial move.
Pep Guardiola
The Manchester City job appears to have had Guardiola's name on it for years - with the pieces seemingly put in place for his arrival at the Etihad.
All it needed was the nod from Guardiola himself and that seems to have moved closer with his decision to leave Bayern Munich at the end of this season. The Premier League looks certain to be his next stop.
Begiristain and Soriano are already in place and ready to welcome the man they worked with to bring such success to Barcelona. Guardiola's arrival would complete the managerial infrastructure you suspect has been the long-held dream to match the fierce ambition of City's Abu Dhabi owners.
Guardiola may yet be diverted off course by offers from elsewhere - perhaps Manchester United or even Chelsea - but all the smart money is on that dream ticket finally being in place at the Etihad at the start of next season.
RATING: 8
Jose Mourinho
Media playback is not supported on this device
Not a chance.
Mourinho was linked with the Barcelona job when Begiristain was at the Nou Camp in 2008 but it was felt his personality was not right and the job went to Guardiola.
Nothing has happened since to suggest City would have a change of heart and entertain Mourinho as their manager.
RATING: 2
Manuel Pellegrini
The 62-year-old Chilean has the biggest opportunity of all to muddy the waters surrounding Guardiola's seemingly inevitable arrival at City by bringing them success this season.
Pellegrini has had his contract extended until the end of next season and City are not just favourites to win the Premier League but also finally have a favourable draw in the last 16 of the Champions League against Dynamo Kiev.
You suspect it will take something special to divert City's attention should Guardiola make it known he wished to manage them - but at least Pellegrini still has the chance to turn heads at the Etihad.

VERDICT: Guardiola simply looks the perfect fit for Manchester City and the framework is already in place behind the scenes with its Barcelona background. Pellegrini may make City think with a title or Champions League - but few would back against Guardiola now.
Pep Guardiola
Guardiola has long been Roman Abramovich's dream choice to manage Chelsea and it seems the Russian owner would be prepared to pay any price to get his hands on him at Stamford Bridge.
However, the Catalan has remained tantalisingly out of reach, perhaps put off by the revolving door for managers at Chelsea and Abramovich's lack of patience when results go wrong.
Guardiola and Chelsea has never seemed a natural fit, despite the perfect London location, and it would take all of Abramovich's pounds and powers of persuasion to make a difference as he searches for a successor to Mourinho.
It seems the overall package is key to Guardiola, not just finance, so Abramovich may be destined to miss out once more.
RATING: 6
Diego Simeone
If a move for Guardiola fails, the 45-year-old Argentine firebrand who has led Atletico Madrid to the Spanish title and a Champions League final they were only seconds away from winning against Real Madrid in 2014 seems an ideal choice.
Fiercely driven, arguably even more combustible in the technical area than Mourinho, Simeone has proved himself by taking Atletico to second in La Liga again this season.
There may be complications. Simeone signed a new five-year deal in March and, while that is hardly insurmountable, the fact he is fiercely, emotionally connected to Atletico is.
Only on Sunday he said: ""Why can't I be here longer? Why did I choose a five-year contract? Because I saw a club that is 'virgin.'""
He added: ""More than a team we are a family - and a real family.""
Abramovich may be left with the tough task of working out a way to break that family up.
RATING: 7
Guus Hiddink
Abramovich's decision to turn to the 69-year-old Dutchman is the sign of the trust he places in Hiddink - especially as his career has fallen off a cliff since he brought the FA Cup to Chelsea in 2009 and was only a last-minute Barcelona equaliser away from the Champions League final.
Hiddink has failed with Russia and Turkey and left his last job in charge of the Netherlands with their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign in tatters. He only succeeded Louis van Gaal in 2014 but lost five of his 10 games in charge.
Possession is nine tenths of the law, so they say, and he may be able to offer a long-term solution if he produces spectacular results - but would he really want to do that at his age, even if he is a success?
Hiddink is surely only the sticking plaster until summer.
RATING: 4
Manuel Pellegrini
Manchester City's manager may be looking for work in the summer and has won the Premier League title as well as having a measure of Champions League success with Villarreal and Malaga.
Experienced and calm, he may be a target should Abramovich miss out on Guardiola and Simeone - but a long shot.
RATING: 4
Didier Drogba
In the stands at Stamford Bridge alongside Abramovich for the first game of the post-Mourinho era, the 3-1 win against Sunderland - and plenty of Chelsea fans would love to see the 37-year-old Champions League-winning legend back in some capacity.
One for the future and possibly part of Hiddink's temporary backroom team but not for the present.
RATING: 2
VERDICT: In an  ideal world Guardiola would be Abramovich's man, but he looks destined for Manchester City so expect Chelsea to go all out to bring in Simeone, whose fiery personality and intense style of management and play will be another big addition to the Premier League.
Pep Guardiola
No imminent vacancies at Arsenal with Arsene Wenger chasing his first title since 2004 and somehow trying to find a way around Barcelona in the Champions League.
What if, though, the 66-year-old who has managed the Gunners since 1996 ends empty-handed and Guardiola is on the market?
Arsenal is actually the perfect fit. New stadium, outstanding infrastructure, huge funds to transform the team. Ideal for any manager in world football.
No sign of change at Arsenal but who knows at the end of the season?

718,"The UMP, led by ex-President Nicolas Sarkozy, boosted the number of councils it controls from 40 to 67 in the vote.
President Francois Hollande's Socialists and other leftists won 34 councils - down from 61 previously.
Marine Le Pen's far-right National Front (FN) won at least 60 seats but failed to get control of any council.
The elections are seen as a key test of public opinion ahead of the 2017 presidential election.
Paris and Lyon, France's two biggest cities, did not take part in Sunday's election.
Mr Sarkozy, who secured the UMP leadership last November, said ""never... has our political family won so many councils"".
He told his supporters that voters had ""massively rejected the policies of Francois Hollande and his government"".
Bastions of the Socialists like the Nord department around Lille swung to the right, as did President Hollande's own fiefdom of the Correze in central France.
More than 90% of the results have been counted for the 4,108 council seats. Local councillors have responsibility for schools, roads and social services in their areas.
As ever in France's two-round elections, voters from left and right united in round two to keep the FN from power, the BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris reports.
Ms Le Pen hailed a ""historic"" day for the FN, saying: ""I thank all our voters for this magnificent success.""
""The goal is near, reaching power and applying our ideas to redress France.""
The FN made especially strong gains in Pas-de-Calais, in the far north, and Gard, in the south.
But the two-round system meant that the FN's strong showing in the first round - a quarter of the total vote - did not translate into seats.
The FN won the European elections in France last year, and surveys suggest that Ms Le Pen could reach the second round run-off in the 2017 presidential election.
Our correspondent says the FN's exclusion from mainstream politics is part of its attraction to disillusioned voters.
It had only one departmental council seat before these elections - but now it has 62. That is still only 1.55% of the total counted so far.
French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said the French people ""have declared... their anger at a daily life that is too difficult"". He vowed to redouble efforts to boost the economy, and said his focus was ""jobs, jobs, jobs"".
He added that the rise in the FN's popularity was ""a sign of a lasting upheaval of our political landscape and we will all need to draw lessons from it"".
Half of the 40-million-strong French electorate abstained from voting - a figure that was, however, better than the 55.3% abstention rate in the last local elections in 2011.

719,"The blast occurred late on Sunday night in the Financial Harbour district of the city.
An opposition group calling itself the February 14 movement has  claimed it was behind the blast.
The Ministry of Interior acknowledged the blast and said it had caused no casualties.
In a statement the ministry said: ""A terrorist group used a gas cylinder to burn a car in Manama at night on Sunday causing an explosion, causing no damage.""
The explosion occurred only a few hours after a press conference given by Samira Rajab, Bahrain's Information Affairs minister.
Ms Rajab had described the situation in Bahrain as ""very reassuring"".  She blamed foreign media for ""blowing the security situation out of proportion"".
""There has been no major escalation of violence on the ground recently as the F1 Bahrain Grand Prix is drawing nearer,"" the minister said.
But there have been daily protests and one hundred have reportedly been arrested in connection with the race.
The claim by February 14 that it carried out the blast cannot be independently verified but if confirmed the attack would mark the first time the group has said it was behind such an attack.
An observer who asked not to be identified expressed surprise that the explosion had occurred in the Financial Harbour.
""Security there is tight. If they can get away with something like that I am worried something big will happen at F1.""
On  social media sites, the 14 February movement has said it will carry out more ""actions"" in a bid to force the cancellation of the race.
However when asked about the blast F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone dismissed concerns,  telling reporters in Shanghai he saw ""no reason""  why the Bahrain race would not be a success.
For the government and its supporters, holding the F1 race demonstrates that after two years of unrest the kingdom is stable and back on track. But many in the opposition oppose the race arguing that the government has failed to deliver on promises of reform.
On 14 February 2011, peaceful protesters took over Pearl Roundabout, an iconic landmark in the capital, Manama. Three days later security forces cleared the site using tear gas, batons and birdshot.

720,"He broke through at Ajax and so began his career directly following the same path as sibling Wesley but the older brother has won the Champions League and played in the World Cup final while Rodney is now trying to rebuild his career at Tannadice.
When asked at his first press conference as a Dundee United player if he liked comparisons with the player who is six years his elder and has performed consistently at elite level, Rodney Sneijder simply responded: ""No.""
Exasperation is understandable, since the family background has been both a help and a hindrance to his development.
While playing for RKC Waalwijk, Rodney Sneijder was at a training camp in Turkey at the same time as rumours were linking his brother with a move from Inter Milan to Galatasaray.
Locals kept turning up and asking him about his brother, including female fans urging him to plead with his brother to make the move.
That kind of frantic, incessant exposure and interest has been something Rodney Sneijder has had to learn to cope with. The brothers both play in midfield, they are clever, technically sound players and are extremely close.
It would be in keeping with the affection and support between them if Wesley visited Tannadice to see Dundee United play on occasion, and Rodney is often seen in the stands at Galatasaray watching his brother while sitting with his sister-in-law.
Yet the legacy is in many ways impossible to live up to, since Wesley Sneijder is among that small group of players who could operate with brilliant individualism and influence at the very pinnacle of the game.
Many in Dutch football consider Rodney Sneijder a talented midfielder, only less gifted than his brother and so far lacking the mental strength, spirit and work-rate to succeed in the Eredivisie.
At the outset of his career, many fans and observers were intrigued to see how the latest member of the family would perform (the eldest of the three Sneijder brothers, Jeffrey, also started out at Ajax but his career was hindered by injury).
Rodney Sneijder was skilful, but just not to the same level as Wesley. At times in his career, there have also been doubts about his work off the ball, his defensive instincts and his ability to deal with set-backs or being left out of the starting line-up.
""Ajax had a lot of talents and he did not make the difference,"" said Voetbal International journalist Stef de Bont. ""The two of them are really close and they look similar. But on the field there's a big difference.
""Wesley is world class, Rodney is more average. He never said it out loud, but it had a big impact on his career.
""In his time at Ajax and FC Utrecht [on loan], at first it was a help. He was a Sneijder, he had to be good so he got a contract. Later, when he didn't make it, there was the comparison.""
Rodney Sneijder is only 24, but his career has been sporadic in terms of first-team football, with only 74 appearances in the past four years.
In 2013, he moved to Almere City, a club in the second tier of Dutch football, although his spells on loan at FC Utrecht - 23 games and three goals in 2011-12 - and his first season following a permanent move to RKC Waalwijk - 22 appearances and two goals in 2012-13 - were productive.
Erwin Koeman was the manager who took Sneijder to RKC Waalwijk, but despite starting brightly, the midfielder drifted out of the teamp and was never able to recover his previous status.
The move to United, then, is a form of career rehabilitation and Sneijder impressed enough as a trialist to persuade Tannadice manager Jackie McNamara to sign the player following recommendation from the player's agent, Pierre van Hooijdonk, a former Celtic team-mate of McNamara's.
The move could work for both parties, since Van Hooijdonk was behind Nadir Ciftci's move to Dundee United, where the striker impressed enough to earn his move to Celtic this summer.
Sneijder has enough potential to be a productive signing but will need to show the mental strength to succeed in a football environment where spirit and assertiveness are commonplace.
The comparisons with Wesley Sneijder are inevitable but also worthless. Rodney Sneijder is making his own way in the game, and now needs to show that he can apply his talent and assert himself to forge his own career.
Moving away from the Netherlands to a club that will provide a platform for him to become a key player is an opportunity he needs to be ready to take.",Rodney Sneijder has never been able to escape the shadow of his brother.,33707010
721,"In a new report, commissioned by Downing Street, he says that people think the UK ""does not have a strategy for growth and wealth creation"".
He wants to devolve power from London to the English regions.
In the Commons, David Cameron and Ed Milliband argued over whether the report backed or damned the government.
Lord Heseltine's report, No Stone Unturned, makes 89 recommendations to help industry. One of its key aims is to move Â£49bn from central government to the English regions to help local leaders and businesses.
The aim, he said, was to devolve power from Whitehall and re-invigorate the big cities that had fuelled the growth and wealth that the country had enjoyed in past decades.
Lord Heseltine, head of the Department of Trade and Industry in the 1980s, said the government should allocate growth funds through the new Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) that are being established in England in place of Regional Development Agencies.
By Nick RobinsonPolitical editor
In 2010, the government invited local business and civic leaders to come forward with proposals for establishing LEPs that reflected natural economic geographies.
Lord Heseltine believes these bodies could be key to stimulating regional growth, but said that, at the moment, LEPs did not currently have ""the authority or resource to transform their locality in the way our economy needs"".
At the national level, however, the government should show greater leadership in promoting major infrastructure projects, Lord Heseltine said. A national growth council should be created, chaired by the prime minister and with a cross-government focus.
""Central government must retain control of important, large scale infrastructure projects. This includes our motorway network, national rail network and airports, as well as our energy networks,"" Lord Heseltine said.
In all these sectors, there must be greater investment and a clearer strategy of what the UK needs. He cited the delay and ""inertia"" over building extra airport capacity in the south east, and called on all the political promises to make firm commitments in their next manifestos about how they will resolve the problem.
Profile: Heseltine still making waves
Lord Heseltine also backed suggestions that pension funds should provide funding for infrastructure projects. With yields on investments in stocks and shares at historically low levels ""there is a well of money looking for a better return than currently available in the market,"" he said.
He said that throughout the regions there was excellence in industry, commerce and academia, which should be extended and that cities were ""pulsing with energy"" that should be unleashed.
He backed the government's economic strategy, and said it was taking the right path to recovery. But later, in an interview with the BBC, Lord Heseltine said there was ""an urgency"" about stimulating growth. ""Across the world there are emerging economies that want our jobs and our wealth,"" he told the Today programme.
""We need to mobilise the skills of provincial England. I want to shove power out of Whitehall, into the provinces,"" he said, adding that ""London has acquired too much power"".
Lord Heseltine admitted his ideas would go down like a ""lead balloon"" in parts of Whitehall because he was suggesting government departments should lose some of their power.
Asked whether his conclusions might be at odds with thinking in the Treasury, Lord Heseltine said: ""I do not work for the Treasury, I work for George Osborne. And George has been behind this initiative.""
He added: ""I have got baggage, they know my views. There are bound to be things where they say, 'oh my god, here he goes again'. I have told it as I see it, but I have told it in a way that is very supportive of the government.""
In the Commons, the Conservative and Labour leaders disputed the report's sentiments. Mr Milliband said that Lord Heseltine's comment that people believe there is no growth strategy was damning.
But Mr Cameron cited the report's conclusion that the coalition government was ""on the right track"". He added that it was an ""excellent"" report, and told Mr Milliband that it was pointless to just trade quotes
Chancellor George Osborne said he would ""study it [the report] very carefully"". He said: ""I wanted Lord Heseltine to do what he does best: challenge received wisdom and give us ideas on how to bring government and industry together. He has done exactly that.""
The Institute of Directors (IoD) business group welcomed the devolution of power to the local. The TUC also supported the report, but said that ministers are going to have to change their attitude towards civil servants, public bodies and unions if they want this strategy to succeed.""",Former Conservative party deputy prime minister Lord Heseltine has urged the government to take bolder action to stimulate the economy.,20142837

723,"Jeremy Pemberton currently works as an NHS chaplain in Lincolnshire, but has been blocked from taking a new job with the NHS in Nottinghamshire.
He was also told he could not work as a priest in Nottinghamshire after he married his partner in April.
His case was raised in the House of Lords earlier this week.
The Acting Bishop for Southwell and Nottingham, the Rt Revd Richard Inwood, issued a statement on 9 July.
He said: ""In its pastoral guidance on same-sex marriage, the House of Bishops said that getting married to someone of the same sex was clearly at variance with the teaching of the Church of England.
""The statement said it would not be appropriate conduct for someone in holy orders to enter into a same-sex marriage, given the need for clergy to model the Church's teaching in their lives.
""In view of this, and having spoken to the Reverend Jeremy Pemberton, his permission to officiate in the Diocese of Southwell and Nottingham was revoked.
""In light of the pastoral guidance and for reasons of consistency, I am unable to issue a licence to Jeremy Pemberton for the post of chaplaincy and bereavement manager, in the Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Trust.""
Mr Pemberton told BBC Radio Nottingham he was ""very, very disappointed"" not to be able to take up the post of chaplaincy and bereavement manager for Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust after the offer was withdrawn on Friday.
""I've now been treated, I think, in an unfair and rather harsh way in Southwell and Nottingham, whereas I'm now going to carry on doing the job I have been doing in Lincolnshire where I have a licence,"" he said.
""So I've been treated in an inconsistent way, and the House of Bishops can't agree amongst themselves what ought to be the processes that somebody who enters a same-sex marriage should go through.""
NHS chaplains are funded by the NHS rather than the Church of England, but a chaplain needs a licence from the relevant diocese.
The Acting Bishop for Southwell and Nottingham, the Rt Revd Richard Inwood, revoked Mr Pemberton's permission to officiate as a priest in June and wrote to the trust in July saying he would not give Mr Pemberton a licence for the new job.
The trust said it was considering its response after receiving the bishop's letter on 7 July, then withdrew the job offer on 1 August.
Mr Pemberton said: ""I think the problem now is that it appears that I'm stuck in the job I'm doing, and if I try to move I could be blocked.
""There are, to be honest, quite a lot of gay and lesbian Church of England chaplains working in the health service.
""Now we don't know, if any of them try to move, will the same thing happen to them, and should it?""
He said he did not know this would happen when he married his partner.
""I didn't, and neither did the House of Bishops, appear to know what would happen,"" he said.
""As soon as they put their pastoral guidance out that very obvious question was asked of them, and the bishops said, 'Oh no, we don't know, we will have to take it on a case-by-case basis.'
""I'm not going to bow out gracefully and take a low profile.

Mr Lewis and his wife Marlene, 77, from Enfield, had stopped to help their 21-year-old grandson after his Ford Fiesta broke down and were trying to call a recovery vehicle when Thompson's car ploughed into the back of them.

726,"It is the work of researchers from the Climate Action Tracker (CAT), a consortium of research institutions.
They examined the commitments already made by governments to limit warming.
The CAT rated seven of the 15 submitted carbon plans as ""inadequate"" to keep temperatures below the accepted level of dangerous warming.
The analysis was released at a UN climate negotiation meeting in Bonn aimed at advancing a new global treaty.
As part of the attempts to tackle global warming, countries have agreed to submit their national plans to the UN before key talks in Paris in December.
So far, 56 governments have published their ""intended nationally determined contributions,"" or INDCs in the jargon of the UN.
The likes of China, the US and the EU have already submitted their intentions. In this analysis, the CAT looked at the plans of 15 countries that between them account for almost 65% of global emissions.
However, seven - including Australia, Canada and Japan - were said to be ""inadequate"", meaning that they are not considered fair contributions to limiting warming to 2C.
Six - including the US, EU and China - were said to be ""medium"", meaning they are consistent with the target.
Two countries, Ethiopia and Morocco, were said to be ""sufficient"", and in line with the 2 degree goal.
""It is clear that if the Paris meeting locks in present climate commitments for 2030, holding warming below 2C could essentially become infeasible, and 1.5 degrees C beyond reach,"" said Bill Hare of Climate Analytics, part of the CAT group.
According to the analysis, the commitments made so far would see temperature rises of up to 3C, with greater impacts on sea-level rise and the frequency of extreme weather events.
Many countries with significant emissions of CO2 have not declared their hands so far, including Indonesia and Brazil.
Brazilian environmentalists have come up with their own INDC at this meeting in an effort to push their government forward.
They claim that the country, the world's seventh biggest emitter, can trim carbon by 35% by 2030 from 2010 levels. They call for an end to deforestation, replanting at least 14 million hectares of native forests and boosting hydropower and biofuels.
""We are showing that it's possible for the country to give a fair and ambitious contribution that is both good for the climate and good for the economy,"" said Carlos Rittl, from the Brazilian Climate Observatory.
The overall lack of progress towards meeting the 2 degree target will not come as a surprise to government officials meeting here to push forward negotiations on a new global compact.
This week they are attempting to cut down an unwieldy 83-page draft text into something more manageable. There are still major divisions over the shape and content of a new treaty, which will attempt to put long-term ambitions to curb carbon into a legally binding form.
Issues of money are never too far from the surface in these talks. In their opening statement, Sudan, on behalf of the African group of countries, affirmed their ""strong reservations"" over the current text.
""The group reaffirms that loss and damage is very critical to the core agreement,"" pointing to the issue of reparations for damages caused by climate change - something that is anathema to richer countries.
It is one of a number of thorny issues that have paralysed progress in this forum. Delegates are aware that they face a very difficult task with just one more week of formal negotiations left after this one, before the parties gather in Paris.","Global plans to curb carbon dioxide are well below what's needed to keep temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees, according to a new analysis.",34135202

They were designed to disguise the true state of the bank's financial health.

731,"The Welsh pop artist is best-known for his celebrity portraits crafted from food and he's attracted commissions from brands like Starbucks, Hovis and Morrisons.
But he's also got topical edge - with one of his works on phone-hacking hitting the front page of a national newspaper in 2012.
So should the 25-year-old be taken seriously? He thinks so.
Mr Wyburn burst onto the scene after becoming an internet sensation on YouTube in 2010 with a toast portrait of X Factor judge Simon Cowell and gained a wider following after appearing on ITV's Britain's Got Talent in 2011.
It was at the inception of his cult status, while studying fine art at Cardiff School of Art & Design, that Mr Wyburn detected a slightly condescending attitude from some lecturers towards his work.
""I don't expect everyone to like it. But people that do, love it. I'm completely fine with it,"" he said.
""I don't mind that it [his work] is going to get looked down upon. All of the pop artists were for so many years.""
Mr Wyburn, who is originally from Ebbw Vale, Blaenau Gwent, may be unashamedly fixated on celebrity culture, but his work has also been recognised for its commentary on current affairs.
His portrait of Rupert Murdoch, made from 5,000 images of alleged phone-hacking victims, featured on the front page of The Guardian.
""It is current to current affairs and current to pop culture. I don't see why that should not be shown in a gallery, in the Tate Gallery or the National Gallery.
""I do strive to be taken seriously. It would be nice to get that sort of recognition,"" he added.
Mr Wyburn said he recently learned that he will be taught as part of the GCSE art curriculum in Wales and the possibility of him being mentioned in the same lesson as his hero Andy Warhol is ""mind-blowing"".
While his fascination for art began in school, Mr Wyburn believes there is little being done to inspire the next generation of artists in British classrooms.
""I don't think there's enough of a push to believe you can have a career in art or to spur people on.
""In school, I didn't know I was able to have it as a career. I don't think many of the teachers would push you enough, encouraging you to be creative people.
""Creative people, in general, are dismissed as non-academic. That's not what it is at all.
""Without creative people, without music, without the artsâ€¦where would we be without culture?""
An unashamed purveyor of popular culture, Mr Wyburn has created images of football manager Fabio Capello from Bolognese sauce and pasta, singer Tom Jones from cassette tape and TV presenter Jeremy Clarkson in motor oil.
He said that, not only was Warhol right to say everyone would one day be famous for 15 minutes, but also insisted the dead artist would have jumped at the chance to appear on celebrity TV.
""He was so obsessive about being on camera 24/7. He made himself a commodity, he made himself a piece of artwork. I think Big Brother would definitely be the one that he would do.""
Mr Wyburn is currently looking forward to the release of his new book, Not That Kind Of Art, in the spring and has created a series of portraits from coffee for Macmillan Cancer Support.
But he is in no doubt about his dream project.
""I'm extremely proud of being Welsh,"" he said.
""I have always said I would like to go into the Millennium Stadium and, using either rugby shirts or rugby balls, make an incredibly large Welsh flag or a portrait of Sam Warburton.""","For a man who's depicted the Queen in Marmite on toast and painted with his feet, it's perhaps unsurprising the art world is a little sniffy about Nathan Wyburn.",34243549

735,"The vast north-eastern Sambisa forest is where they have many bases - and it has been subject to aerial bombardments since February.
There has been speculation that some of the Chibok schoolgirls kidnapped more than a year ago are being held there.
Boko Haram has killed thousands in northern Nigeria since 2009.
Nigeria's military, backed by troops from neighbouring countries, launched an offensive against Boko Haram in February - and has recaptured most of the territory the militants had taken in the previous year.
For the latest news, views and analysis see the BBC Africa Live page.
Some of the abducted schoolgirls, who escaped shortly after they were seized, have told the BBC they had been kept in militant camps in the Sambisa forest.
BBC Africa security correspondent Tomi Oladipo says the Nigerian military has been steadily reclaiming territory from the insurgents and sees the takeover of Sambisa as one of its biggest goals.
But our correspondent says the Sambisa forest, which incorporates a former game reserve, is far larger than any other territory that has been fought over so far.
The aerial bombardments on Sambisa, which is mainly in north-eastern Borno state, have been slowed down by weather conditions and poor visibility, he says.
Military spokesman Major-General Chris Olukolade refused to give any further details about the offensive.

Who are the militants?
Outgoing President Goodluck Jonathan has been widely criticised for not doing enough to end the conflict.
But his government has now vowed to crush the group before he hands over to President-elect Muhammadu Buhari at the end of May.
An estimated three million people have been forced from their homes since 2009, when Boko Haram launched its insurgency to create an Islamic state.
Hundreds have also been kidnapped by the group, including more than 200 girls taken from their boarding school in the Borno town of Chibok last April.

Birmingham have drawn their past two league meetings with Manchester City, both of which were away from home, including 3 May's 1-1 draw in the Women's Super League One Spring Series.
The two sides were also level after 90 minutes in October's Continental Cup final, before England right-back Lucy Bronze won the game for Manchester City in extra-time.
""We don't fear them at all. Obviously they are a good team, they have a lot of great players,"" Carter said of the Women's Champions League semi-finalists.

Saturday's final at Wembley will see two close friends go head-to-head in Manchester City's defensive third, with centre-back Steph Houghton up against Birmingham striker Ellen White.
When asked about the threats Birmingham will pose, England captain Houghton highlighted her England team-mate White.

739,"In a BBC interview, the WTO's director general, Roberto Azevedo, said Britain would not have the same negotiating leverage as the EU.
Britain could have to impose £9bn worth of additional tariffs on imports, raising the cost of living.
Exporters could face an extra £5bn of tariffs on their sales abroad.
Those figures for additional tariffs on goods going into or out of the UK come from the WTO analysis of preferential trade arrangements.
Under WTO rules, member countries are generally supposed to apply the same level of tariffs to goods wherever they come from. But there are exemptions for preferential regional and bilateral trade agreements.
So, we can allow into the UK goods duty free from the EU and from countries with which the EU has negotiated preferential deals.  Such agreements are already in force for Turkey, Switzerland and South Korea, for example.
How trade and the UK's economy are affected by membership of the EU.
The EU itself is another case of a trade agreement (and more). Others are being negotiated, including the controversial Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the United States.
On leaving the EU, the UK would no longer be party to those agreements (unless replacements had been negotiated in the meantime). Without a deal in place, we would, under WTO rules, have to impose tariffs on goods from the rest of the EU and those other countries.
That would raise the cost to consumers and to businesses buying imported goods. The only way to avoid that under WTO rules would be to eliminate the tariffs altogether.
That is the approach favoured by some Brexit supporters, notably the economist Prof Patrick Minford. That kind of unilateral trade liberalisation does find some support in economic theory, but it tends to be politically difficult. It exposes industry to new competition without gaining better access for exporters.
Mr Azevedo mentioned two examples that have no tariffs on imports: Hong Kong and Macao. But it's very unusual.
In practice, it seems unlikely that any British government would go that far in the foreseeable future.
Equally, those other countries - the EU and those with EU preferential agreements - would have to impose tariffs on British goods at whatever rate they have set for the same goods from other WTO member countries.
Then there are the rest of the WTO member countries to consider, including some very important trading nations such as China, India and the US. Would they accept the UK simply adopting the EU tariffs? Or would they want to negotiate afresh? Mr Azevedo said it is ""very difficult to tell"".
In some areas, it would simply make no sense to adopt the EU's WTO commitments, especially farm subsidies. The EU has made commitments to limit them. The UK couldn't realistically expect other countries to accept the same cap. ""Other members would definitely not agree to that,"" Mr Azevedo says.
Realistically, no British government would want to spend as much as the whole EU does on farm subsidies, but the issue is very important to many other WTO member so it is likely that a cap would need to be agreed.
How keen does he think other members would be to negotiate? ""I don't know exactly how members are going to behave and what kind of engagement there will be,"" Mr Azevedo says.
Nor could be sure how long negotiations would take.
""Two, three, four years. It can take a decade or more. It depends on the complexities of the negotiations and the appetite for members to do it quickly.""
In the meantime, ""there would be a vacuum. The UK would be the only WTO member without a list of its commitments… it's a legal uncertainty"".
In the interim, he said, it was ""theoretically possible"" that WTO members could treat the UK as they would a country that is not a member. That means potentially erecting significant new barriers to British goods and services, though he did not appear to think that the most likely picture.
He said: ""They would most likely want to negotiate and make the rules of the game absolutely certain and legally binding for both sides.""
Still, he did identify a downside. Investors want profitability and predictability ""and predictability would be gone in this situation"".
Campaigners for a leave vote often argue that because Britain is a large prosperous economy that imports more than it exports, our trade partners would have powerful incentives to negotiate seriously.
There is certainly some truth in that. But the WTO chief is very far from convinced that it would all fall into place quickly or easily.
Mr Azevedo, the world's top trade official, said ""I don't have a crystal ball and the message I am bringing to you is that nobody has that crystal ball.""

The former banana exporter denies accusations of money laundering and receiving favourable loans before he entered politics.
He says the allegations are a political smear by his opponents.
It is unclear if the judge will rule whether there is a case to answer before Mr Moise takes office on 7 February.
The investigation was launched in 2013 as a routine bank-regulation procedure.
The investigating judge took no action until four opposition senators demanded information about the findings.

Critics accused her of staging the visit and playing down the problem.
Her photos were quickly deleted and were blamed on a public relations slip.
However, French media had already captured the pictures, which showed Ms Schiappa walking alone in a dress past a group of men on a central street in the north-eastern area of La Chapelle-Pajol.
Accompanying the images was the message: ""The Republic's laws protect women and apply every hour of the day and everywhere.""
Ms Schiappa is new to national politics and one of President Emmanuel Macron's rising stars from civil society. Before joining his centrist party, she was best known for setting up a network of working mothers and was deputy mayor of the city of Le Mans.
Last month, La Chapelle-Pajol hit the headlines when local women took to the streets to protest that their area was becoming a no-go area for women.
A group, SOS LA Chapelle, launched a petition under the title: ""Women, an endangered species in the heart of Paris."" They said the main square and nearby streets had become men-only zones.
Paris authorities have acknowledged the ""strong feeling of insecurity"" in the area, amid complaints of drug-trafficking and pickpocketing, as well as intimidation and harassment.
With France in the midst of an election campaign, the issue became political and critics suggested that the campaign had become caught up in anti-immigrant sentiment. The area has a large immigrant population and Porte de la Chapelle, a short distance away, has become home to migrants living outside in poor conditions.
After the photos were taken down, her office issued a statement (in French) setting out the local groups Ms Schiappa had met and detailing her efforts to tackle sexual discrimination in La Chapelle. She had visited the area anonymously on Monday and would return at a later date.
Centre-right politician Pierre Liscia was unimpressed, complaining of an ""appalling attitude"" that treated local women with contempt and ridicule. The only point of her night-time visit had been to show that nothing was wrong in the district.
A number of others took to social media to criticise the minister's trip.

745,"Bowel Cancer UK says conducting more tests sooner would help as it is one of the most common causes of cancer-related deaths in the UK.
In Wales, a national bowel screening programme aims to reduce the number of bowel cancer deaths by 15% by 2020.
The Welsh government is spending an extra Â£4m to improve diagnostic tests.
The charity's report said the situation in Wales was ""particularly poor"" with 15% of patients waiting between eight and 14 weeks, and 26% waiting over 14 weeks for a colonoscopy, an internal bowel examination, when they are suspected to have problem.
A Welsh government spokesman said: ""Nine out of ten patients newly diagnosed with cancer via the urgent suspected cancer route start treatment with in our 62 day target. This includes having diagnostic tests.
""When talking about general diagnostic waits, that exclude cancer, the eight week wait for specified diagnostic waiting times in Wales is a target which we expect to be met and sustained as a standard.
""To achieve this we have recently given health boards an extra Â£4m to improve diagnostic tests in Wales. We expect to see significant improvement over the next few months.""
The charity also highlighted data from a national colonoscopy audit which it says showed the rate of colonoscopies conducted in Welsh health units fell ""woefully short"" of the UK average of 32.2 procedures per 100,000 of population with a figure of 23.3 in Wales compared to 46.8 in Scotland.
In Wales, a national bowel screening programme offers a test kit to men and women aged between 60 and 74 to help with early diagnosis of any problems.
Public Health Wales runs the Bowel Screening Wales service in line with other national programmes, including Breast Test Wales and Cervical Screening Wales.
The Bowel Cancer UK report, Right test, right time, says people across the UK are waiting significant lengths of time between being referred and having their test.
It says figures for England show less than 2% waiting more than the recommended waiting time whereas in Scotland performance has dropped, with 6.8% waiting longer than the recommended six week waiting time target.
The health service in Northern Ireland had not met its target of no patient waiting more than nine weeks, according to the Bowel Cancer UK report.","Waiting times for tests are ""poor"" for patients suspected of having bowel cancer in Wales and others parts of the UK, says a charity.",27610971

748,"Proposals to be announced on Monday could end the six-month notice period landlords must give.
More than a million people now live in rented properties in Wales.
A Welsh government spokesman said it would ""improve and simplify the law"" for tenants and it had consulted widely on the proposal.
While the majority of people in Wales still live in social housing, the private sector is expected to outgrow it within the next five years.
There are already parts of Wales where the number of privately rented homes outnumber social housing properties including Cardiff, Ceredigion, Conwy, Denbighshire, Powys and the Vale of Glamorgan.
But the standard of privately rented properties can vary greatly, partly because the law surrounding rental homes is so complex.
The Welsh government's answer is its Renting Homes Bill due to be launched on Monday.
Dr Bob Smith, a housing expert from Cardiff University, said: ""There have been issues about needing to better regulate the private sector and they were addressed by legislation introduced last year (Housing Wales Act).
""The Renting Homes Bill is much more concerned with simplifying contractual relationships between landlords and tenants.""
The bill is expected to outline a number of measures to set out the rights and responsibilities of landlords and tenants, and to make the process of renting easier.
It includes the introduction of just two tenancy types - one for social housing and one for the private sector - a more flexible approach to joint tenancies and standardised succession rights.
Steve Clarke, managing director of Welsh Tenants, which represents those in private and social accommodation, said it had been a long time coming.
""What this will attempt to do is to simplify the law so everyone understands their rights and obligations better,"" he said.
But there is concern it could include a plan to remove the protection private tenants currently have against so-called ""no fault"" evictions in the first six months.
John Puzey, director of Shelter Cymru said: ""The idea of removing it is an extraordinary proposal. It will mean we will have the most insecure form of private tenure in the whole of Western Europe in Wales.""
Elle McNeill, policy officer with Citizens Advice Cymru, believes there is a risk it could lead to an increase in evictions.
""Our concern is that it removes what little security there is at the moment in the private rented sector,"" she said.
""That's not to say that landlords will start evicting people immediately, it's that they could do if they wanted to.""
But landlady Liz Davies, from Newport, believes scrapping the six-month term will give landlords and tenants greater flexibility.
""Landlords' hands are tied with having to give someone a six-month tenancy,"" she said.
""What tenants have to understand is that they are financially obligated for those six months.""
""To think that I could potentially uproot the children, move somewhere and then be asked to move within six months, that is really worrying.""
Rebecca has been asked to leave two properties unexpectedly over the past five years because landlords wanted to give the houses to relatives.
She wants to see the new legislation go further to give tenants better protection.
""In the social housing sector for landlords to obtain an eviction they have to show their actions are proportionate."" she said.
""I really feel the same level of consideration should be given to those in the private rented sector.""
A Welsh government spokesman said its aim was to improve and simplify the law and its consultation on the bill had received considerable support from a number of housing agencies.

749,"Dozens of politicians have already been arrested as part of the inquiry.
Mr Fachin was chosen at random from a shortlist of five Supreme Court judges.
He replaces Teori Zavascki, 69, who died in a plane crash on 19 January.
Mr Zavascki's plane fell into the sea in heavy rain near Paraty, some 250km (160 miles) south of Rio de Janeiro.
He was a well-respected judge and the Car Wash investigation gained much credibility when he was appointed to oversee it in the Supreme Court, says the BBC's Daniel Gallas.
Most recently, Mr Zavascki had been investigating executives from Odebrecht, Latin America's largest construction firm.
Odebrecht has admitted paying $1bn (£800m) in bribes to obtain contracts in 12 different countries.
One of Mr Fachin's first tasks will be to analyse the plea bargain deals struck with 77 Odebrecht executives.
Local media say their testimonies could contain the names of high-ranking politicians allegedly involved in the bribery scheme.
Mr Fachin, a law professor from Parana state, was appointed to the Supreme Court by former President Dilma Rousseff, who was impeached in August.

751,"Despite falling unemployment, wage growth is weak because the supply of labour has also gone up, says the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD).
The CIPD said for every low-skilled job, there were 24 applicants.
There were also 19 candidates for every medium-skilled job and eight for every high-skilled vacancy.
The CIPD's quarterly Labour Market Survey of employers, carried out in association with the Adecco Group, said the workforce had been boosted by more workers from other EU countries, as well as by older workers and former welfare claimants.
The report's author, Gerwyn Davies, who is senior labour market adviser at the CIPD, said pay had been expected to rise along with employment, but such predictions were ""the dog that hasn't barked for some time now"".
""We are still yet to see tangible signs of this situation changing in the near term,"" he added.
""The facts remain that productivity levels are stagnant [and] public sector pay increases remain modest, while wage costs and uncertainty over access to the EU market have increased for some employers.
""At the same time, it is also clear that the majority of employers have still been able to find suitable candidates to employ at current wage rates, due to a strong labour supply until now.""
Not all recent surveys back up the CIPD's view. Last week, a survey of employment agencies found that the UK labour market was tightening, with employers finding it harder to recruit staff.
The survey, carried out by market research firm Markit for the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC), said that pay rates for both permanent and temporary staff were rising quickly because of a continuing fall in the number of job applicants.

It wants £700m of new government funding earmarked for social care by 2020 to be brought forward.
The government said it was offering more financial support to councils.
The government is allowing councils to raise council tax by 2% to help meet the rising costs of social care, under plans announced in the 2015 Autumn Statement.
According to Local Government Association  (LGA) figures, this could bring in about £372m in 2016-17.
But it warns this could be wiped out by meeting the costs of the new £7.20 National Living Wage, for those aged over 25, which comes into force in April.
The LGA says the increased costs of contracts for home care and residential care providers could cost councils a minimum of £330m in 2016-17.
""The cost of implementing it will significantly add to the growing pressure on services caring for the elderly and disabled which are already at breaking point,"" said councillor Izzi Seccombe, the LGA's community wellbeing spokeswoman.
""A lack of funding is already leading to providers pulling out of the publicly-funded care market and shifting their attention towards people who are able to fully fund their own care.
""We know that care home and domiciliary care providers cannot be squeezed much further.""
The government said care workers would benefit from the National Living Wage, and added that it was making up to £3.5bn available for councils to meet social care costs.
A spokesman said: ""The new National Living Wage (NLW) is an essential part of moving to a higher wage, lower tax, lower welfare society, where work always pays and the majority of households are better off.

Shows has removed 3,018 tonnes of waste but because of ""weather and transport"", about ""700 to 1,000"" tonnes remain.
The agency has begun an investigation into the cause of the swarms.
Updates on this story and more from Derbyshire
About 3,000 households and businesses are in the affected areas, prompting Shows to be suspended on 17 May from taking waste.
Resident Amanda Cairns has called for compensation for people affected, but the agency said this was a civil matter.
Ms Carins said: ""You couldn't cook. If you put your cup down on the table, you got flies landing in your cup of tea or coffee.""
""You were sterilising your worktops non-stop. We had to have nets upon doors, fly sprays, I've tried vodka, basil, everything.""

757,"Central bank data suggests there are more than six billion 100-bolivar notes in circulation, making up almost half of all currency.
Venezuelans will have 10 days from Wednesday to exchange the notes for coins and new, higher-value bills.
President Nicolas Maduro said the move would stop gangs hoarding the notes.
But in India, a similar move to scrap high-value bank notes last month has caused major disruption.
In a surprise announcement, Mr Maduro said on Sunday that the 100-bolivar note, worth about 2 US cents (£0.015) on the black market, would be taken out of circulation on Wednesday.
The president said the aim was to tackle transnational gangs which hoard the Venezuelan notes abroad, a move he has in the past described as part of the ""economic war"" being waged against his government.
He said the gangs held more than 300bn bolivares worth of currency, most of it in 100-bolivar notes.
President Maduro said there were ""entire warehouses full of 100-bolivar notes in the [Colombian cities of] Cucuta, Cartagena, Maicao and Buaramanga"".
He said part of the plan was to block any of the 100-bolivar notes from being taken back into the country so the gangs would be unable to exchange their hoarded bills, making them worthless.
""I have given the orders to close all land, maritime and air possibilities so those bills taken out can't be returned and they're stuck with their fraud abroad,"" he said speaking on television.
Venezuela's currency has fallen dramatically amid skyrocketing inflation.
On the black market, its value dropped by 55% against the US dollar just in the past month, and the International Monetary Fund estimates that next year's prices will rise by more than 2,000%.
Gangs can therefore buy up Venezuelan banknotes cheaply on the black market in exchange for dollars or Colombian pesos.
They then use the Venezuelan currency to buy subsidised goods in Venezuela, which they in turn sell at a profit in neighbouring Colombia.
Many Venezuelans living near the border buy Colombian pesos to purchase goods in Colombia which they cannot get in Venezuela due to chronic shortages.
President Maduro blames both the shortages and Venezuela's record inflation on ""imperialist forces"" he says are trying to bring down his government.
He said the aim of these ""forces"" was ""to destabilise out economy and our society, to leave the country without 100-bolivar notes"".
Analysts say the move is likely to worsen the cash crunch in Venezuela, where people have already been limited in the amount of cash they can take out at automated teller machines.
Venezuelans have only been given 10 days to exchange their 100-bolivar notes for new coins and bills ranging from 500 to 20,000 bolivars due to be introduced from 15 December.
Critics of Mr Maduro have predicted chaos and doubt that the facilities will be in place for people to exchange all their 100-bolivar notes.

760,"Although the game itself was unremarkable, especially during a flat second half, it was still a highly eventful debut day for the former Preston, Everton and Manchester United boss, featuring a diverted aeroplane, a series of selection decisions, a bizarre touchline bust-up and a midnight finish.
So how did he fare?
Spanish media coverage of La Real's trip to Deportivo was utterly dwarfed by none other than Lionel Messi, who just happened to break the all-time La Liga goalscoring record roughly half an hour before Moyes's debut got under way.
National interest was further minimised by the additional considerations that league leaders Real Madrid and reigning champions Atletico Madrid had already played earlier in the day, along with the fact that the game had been given the dreaded 'graveyard shift' 22:00 kick-off slot.
Indeed, the fixture's lack of prestige was laid painfully bare by the fact that although it was the only fixture of the weekend made available for free-to-air television viewing, national broadcasters Cuatro elected to shunt the game to an obscure lesser station and reserve their main channel for an airing of animated children's movie Madagascar 3.
An early lesson about life in Spain, then, for David Moyes: whatever you do, everyone will still be talking about Lionel Messi.
The Scot's preparations for his La Liga bow took an unexpected turn when bad weather re-routed the team's flight to A Coruna to nearby Santiago De Compostela, the famous Catholic pilgrimage site (is that an omen?).
After finally making their way to Deportivo's Riazor stadium, Moyes was able to name his first Real Sociedad team - and there were more changes that he had wished to make because of a series of injuries.
In particular, Moyes was forced to field a makeshift central defensive partnership of Ion Ansotegi and Gorka Elustondo in the absence of regular starters Inigo Martinez and Mikel Gonzalez.
Another big decision concerned the identity of his goalkeeper, with Enaut Zubikarai failing to impress since replacing Barcelona-bound Claudio Bravo at the start of the season and summer signing Geronimo Rulli pushing for a debut after recovering from injury. In the end, however, Moyes opted to retain faith with Zubikarai.
One interesting selection was Sergio Canales, the former Real Madrid and Valencia midfielder whose talent has never been in doubt but who has frequently failed to deliver. He was picked on the right of midfield.
Moyes also overturned the much-debated decision of predecessor Jagoba Arrasate to sideline popular right-back Carlos Martinez, handing the 28-year-old only his third start of the season and leaving Arrasate's preferred choice Joseba Zaldua on the bench.
Moyes's team lined up in a 4-4-2 formation - a playing system rarely used in Spain - with former Arsenal striker Carlos Vela given license to roam alongside Imanol Agirretxe in attack.
Heeding their new manager's pre-match call for intensity and pace, La Real looked to get the ball forward as quick as possible, especially into wide areas with the intention of delivering crosses into the box.
Moyes reportedly spent lots of time rehearsing set-pieces with his new players ahead of the game, and there also appeared to be an emphasis on launching swift counter-attacks.
During the opening half, his team were well on top and came close to breaking the deadlock on a number of occasions, with Vela looking particularly menacing.
But they faded badly in the second period, struggling to sustain any attacking pressure and forced to drop ever deeper as hosts Deportivo pushed for a valuable winner.
Midway through the second period, Moyes made a tactical switch by withdrawing winger Chory Castro and introducing central midfielder Ruben Pardo, with Vela dropping wide in a 4-5-1 formation in an attempt to establish more control over possession.
The plan did not work as Deportivo continued to look the more likely scorers, and Moyes was ultimately grateful to secure a point after goalkeeper Zubikarai justified his selection with a good late save from on-loan Real Madrid midfielder Jose Rodriguez.
If Moyes needed a reminder about the tendency of the Spanish temperament to indulge in flamboyant emotional outbursts - quite different from the stoic Scots - he was provided with one just half an hour into his first game in the country.

After Vela came close to scoring the opener with a speedy break, Deportivo assistant coach Roberto Cabellud exploded with fury on the touchline, approaching the visiting bench and directing his anger at Moyes, who reacted by standing on the edge of his technical area and producing the universal 'calm down' hand-pushing sign, with the effect that he appeared to be repeatedly patting an invisible large dog.
The Scot looked perplexed as referee Eduardo Prieto sent the unruly Cabellud straight down the tunnel and, although the cause of the spectacular fit of rage was not immediately clear, reports soon circulated that the Deportivo coach was enraged because Moyes had supposedly stepped onto the pitch during Vela's run towards goal.
Perhaps it's just as well that Moyes's La Liga debut didn't come against Atletico Madrid and Mono Burgos…
Real Sociedad's performance - starting well but finishing poorly - was not a surprise to the club's fans, judging by their comments on social media.
A lack of physical conditioning was one of the chief complaints directed against predecessor Arrasate, and although La Real supporters were clearly unhappy with the way their team faded, there was little in the way of dissent against the new manager.
Instead, the tone was more realistic, with one fan quipping: ""Moyes is going to pack up his suitcase again now,"" and another summing up the mood of disenchantment with the former regime by opining: ""A year and a half of Jagoba [Arrasate] can't be fixed in a week.""
The same views were shared by leading sports newspaper Marca, whose match report carried the headline: ""Moyes has a lot of work ahead of him,"" while El Pais billed the game as a ""tepid debut for Moyes"".
And 'tepid' is perhaps the best word to describe an encounter which could have been a lot better but was by no means all bad for Real Sociedad.
Despite having trained for little more than a week under their new manager, there was a clear gameplan and a commitment to fight for a point when the going got tough in the final stages - qualities which were not always been evident under Arrasate. And the biggest positive of all: it was their first clean sheet of the season.

762,"PM Tony Abbott said the government was proposing a range of civil penalties and fees linked to foreign investment.
Property prices are a hot button issue in Australia, especially in Sydney, and there are claims foreign investment is artificially boosting house prices.
But Mr Abbott conceded there was not enough data on this issue.
He also ruled out reviewing Australia's negative gearing rules, which some property analysts say also fuel property prices.
Negative gearing is when an investment generates a negative cashflow and allows the investor to claim tax deductions.
The proposals follow announcements earlier this year by the government that it was tightening the rules for foreign investment in agricultural land.
Under the new proposals, a foreign investor who wants to buy Australian property worth up to A$1m ($785,000, Â£508,000) would have to pay a A$5,000 application fee to the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB).
Investments over A$1m will incur a A$10,000 fee for every extra million dollars in the purchase price.
An application to buy a business worth A$1bn or more would incur a A$100,000 fee.
Foreign investors found to be in breach of the rules would be fined up to 25% of the value of the investment and could be forced to sell the property.
A register will be established to record how many foreign residential and agricultural property owners are in Australia and who they are.
The government said Australia's foreign investment policy for residential real estate had been designed to increase Australia's housing stock but a lack of compliance and enforcement of the rules in recent years had threatened the integrity of the policy.
""We do want Australians to be operating on a level playing field,"" Mr Abbott said of the property market.
""This government is determined to ensure that the aspirational people of our country get the fairest possible go,"" he said.
Fears about foreign investment in property, particularly Chinese investment, have prompted the Australian government's proposed changes to its foreign investment regime.
There are perceptions in the community that young Australians are being priced out of the market by offshore speculative investors.
This is probably the biggest foreign investment debate in Australia apart from Chinese investment in farm land. But many ""foreign buyers"" are actually Australians of Chinese or Indian descent.
The government says the new rules will ""even up the playing field"" but that avoids the fact that most young home buyers are being outbid by cashed-up Australian baby boomers.
Short-term speculation may cool but big investors can afford the fees. Smaller players looking for long-term investment for their children or residency and citizenship will see it as a price worth paying to improve the outlook for future generations.
""The only foreigners that will be in the system will be those playing by the rules.""
Applications by foreign investors to buy Australian property or businesses are currently free.
The fees outlined by the government are much higher than those recommended in a report by a parliamentary economics committee.
Submissions on the proposals are being accepted by the Treasury until 20 March, and the government will make a final decision some time after that.
From 1 March, the FIRB screening threshold for purchases will be reduced from the current level of A$252m to A$15m, with a foreign ownership register of agricultural land also due to be established.","Foreign investors may have to pay large fees before buying Australian residential real estate or businesses, the government has announced.",31615314

766,"His proclamation ordered agencies to ease the economic burden of the laws known as Obamacare.
In Friday's inaugural address he pledged to put ""America first"" and to end the ""American carnage"" of abandoned factories and rampant crime.
Later, about 200,000 people are due to join a Women's March in Washington.
Organisers say they want to highlight racial and gender equality and other issues perceived to be under threat from Mr Trump's administration.
Similar marches have taken place in Australia, New Zealand and in Asian cities, and many others are getting under way around the world.
BBC Washington correspondent Barbara Plett-Usher says Mr Trump has vowed to do what he can immediately using executive action, chalking up early victories before he has to turn to the grinding work of getting bills through Congress.
His team quickly overhauled the White House website to include his pledge to roll back Barack Obama's strategy on climate change.
Shortly after taking office as the 45th US president, Mr Trump sent his Cabinet nominations to the Senate.
He signed a waiver to allow retired General James Mattis to serve as defence secretary, even though he left the military less than the required seven years ago.
Gen Mattis, whose appointment has been approved by the Senate, was later sworn in by Vice-President Mike Pence.
Mr Pence also swore in John Kelly as head of Homeland Security.
The revamped White House website replaces Mr Obama's policies with Mr Trump's new agenda.
The new administration lists only six issues on the website - energy, foreign policy, jobs and growth, military, law enforcement and trade deals.
Critics point out that it makes no mention of civil rights, LGBT rights, healthcare or climate change.
One of Mr Trump's key election pledges was to repeal and replace President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act.
Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said President Trump's executive order was for federal departments to ""minimise the economic burden""' of the act, but he gave no details.
Mr Trump also signed a proclamation declaring a national day of patriotism.
Asked about his first day, which was capped by a dance with First Lady Melania to My Way, Mr Trump said ""it was busy but good  - a beautiful day.''
In his inaugural address, Mr Trump, 70, struck a nationalist, protectionist tone.
""From this moment on, it's going to be America First. We will follow two simple rules: Buy American and hire American,"" he said.
Mr Trump accused Washington politicians of abandoning citizens to industrial decline and spiralling rates of crime.
""This American carnage stops right here and stops right now,"" he said.
""Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American families.""
Following the ceremony, some protesters took to the streets in Washington, smashing windows of businesses and denouncing capitalism and the new president.
Police in riot gear dispersed them using pepper spray.

With star striker Cristiano Ronaldo missing because of a thigh injury, a cautious Real side offered little goal threat until the closing stages.
But in the last 20 minutes, Jese headed against the bar for the Spanish side before Hart brilliantly denied Casemiro and Pepe from corners.
Hart showed great reactions to keep out Casemiro's header with his foot but his block to deny Pepe, who was unmarked and five yards from goal, is the standout reason City will travel to Spain next week with a precious clean sheet.
The closest City came to a goal of their own was when Keylor Navas tipped over Kevin de Bruyne's dipping free-kick in stoppage time.
Relive a tense first leg at Etihad Stadium
Football Daily podcast: 'A professional European display by Manchester City'
That was Navas' only save of a game that was billed as a shootout between two attacking sides but was, in fact, a game largely devoid of goalmouth action.
City will take the positives from denying Real an away goal but England's last remaining representatives in Europe's elite competition still face a huge task if they are to reach the final, in Milan on 28 May.
Their failure to score at home means former Real boss Manuel Pellegrini does not have a lead to take back to the Bernabeu, where Zinedine Zidane's side have not conceded a goal in the Champions League all season.
The news Ronaldo's thigh muscle was deemed too tight for him to play was clearly a massive boost for City before their first Champions League semi-final.
Without their 47-goal top scorer, a Real side that had scored 133 goals in their previous 46 games this season seemed reluctant to commit men forward and struggled to create chances.
Gareth Bale, playing his first game in England since his £85m move to Real from Spurs in 2013, was unable to provide the spark in Ronaldo's absence.
Bale did get the better of Gael Clichy early on down the right but failed to find a team-mate with his crosses and his finishing was also below his usual standards.
The Wales winger cut in to send one curling shot bouncing wide in the second half but disappointed with a free-kick from the edge of the box which he fired against the City wall.
Both of Real's late chances came from set-pieces and they struggled to open up City.
The home side were not helped by David Silva being forced off by injury before half-time and were short of their customary zip in the final third.
Sergio Aguero was starved of service and only managed one shot at goal, which came when he fired over from the edge of the box at the start of the second half.
The former Atletico Madrid striker has now played Real 13 times in his career and has still never beaten them, but will get another chance on Wednesday, 4 May.
In truth, City's whole attack will have to do better in the second leg.
De Bruyne, who started in the number 10 role but ended up on the left after Silva's injury, was also short of inspiration, Jesus Navas made few inroads down the right and Kelechi Iheanacho's pace had little impact.
Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini:
""We played a very intense game and defended well. We tried to create until David Silva got injured then we lost the ball too much. If you cannot win then a 0-0 draw is good.
""We knew they were going to play a slow game and that is why we pressed as a team. When we had the ball, we could not make the difference. We could not score.""

Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany:
""It is too close to call at the moment - 0-0 is a very dangerous scoreline.
""From the moment we manage to score in Madrid, it will be very different.
""It is hard to keep a clean sheet against such an attacking team. We can be proud of what we have achieved in this first leg.""
The first leg of the other semi-final, between Atletico Madrid and Bayern Munich, takes place in Spain on Wednesday.
Before their trip to Madrid, City travel to Southampton on Sunday in a 16:30 BST kick-off. With three league games remaining, Pellegrini's side are still in need of Premier League points to secure a top-four finish that will make sure of Champions League football next season too.
Real, third in La Liga and a point behind leaders Barcelona, are already certain of their Champions League place but are still in the title race. They also have an away game this weekend - against Real Sociedad at 15:00 BST on Saturday.

This had suggested Monroe had either vandalised a war memorial or ""condoned or approved"" of it, the blogger said.
Hopkins told the BBC: ""No comment.""
Monroe told the programme Hopkins's tweets had left the blogger ""absolutely horrified"".
""My brother is an officer in RAF, my dad was a paratrooper in the Falklands,"" Monroe said.
""As part of the evidence [from the trial], I've got six A4 ring-binders of tweets I received - somebody telling me I should be shot in the head, put in a wheelchair - all sorts of abuse.
""It wasn't just in the aftermath in May [2015].

""It's been almost two years of weekly legal meetings,"" Monroe said. ""So it's a huge weight lifted.
""I hope it teaches people to be a bit nicer to each other.""
The case arose after some Twitter users highlighted an anti-Conservative profanity daubed on a memorial to the women of World War Two during an anti-austerity demonstration.
In May 2015, Hopkins tweeted: ""@MsJackMonroe scrawled on any memorials recently? Vandalised the memory of those who fought for your freedom. Grandma got any more medals?""
The judge presiding over the case, Mr Justice Warby, ruled that the tweet ""meant that Ms Monroe condoned and approved of scrawling on war memorials, vandalising monuments commemorating those who fought for her freedom"".
He found that a second tweet from Hopkins ""meant that Ms Monroe condoned and approved of the fact that in the course of an anti-government protest there had been vandalisation by obscene graffiti of the women's war memorial in Whitehall, a monument to those who fought for her freedom"".
The judge added: ""These are meanings with a defamatory tendency, which were published to thousands.""
Monroe said Hopkins had initially been asked to delete her tweet, but ""she didn't respond to me being nice"".
""She blocked me immediately instead of responding,"" Monroe said.
""So then I said, 'Make a donation and it goes away.'
""And she didn't respond to that. In the months that followed, I made several offers to her to make an apology [without receiving one].""
Monroe added: ""I've got a lot of compassion for her actually.
""It can't be nice for the whole world to be waiting for your downfall.

772,"In a report due to be released on Thursday, Vivek Murthy recommends more regulation and taxation.
His report agrees that e-cigarettes are less harmful than actual ones, but his concern is that the devices expose children to the risks of nicotine.
E-cigarettes are devices that turn nicotine liquid into a vapour.
Because they do not actually burn any material but leave users merely inhaling nicotine in steam, they are seen by some health experts as preferable to smoking cigarettes and, by some, as a way to give up cigarette smoking.
Dr Murthy's report says there is not enough evidence that prove e-cigarettes work in this way.
For young people, he says, e-cigarette use is strongly linked with the use of other tobacco products.
Dr Murthy says nicotine usage by young people risks mood disorders, attention deficits and addiction to nicotine that could lead to the use of traditional cigarettes.
Many tobacco companies are pinning their future on e-cigarettes and other alternatives as people continue to move away from using traditional nicotine products.
Last month, Marlboro maker Philip Morris launched a new product in the UK, Iqos, which it said could mean halting sales of its conventional tobacco products.","The chief public health officer of the US, the Surgeon General, has called the use of e-cigarettes by children ""a major public health concern"".",38247778

Excessive regulation, they argue, poses a threat to London's pre-eminence in the global financial services industry.
The Remain side says EU exit will lead to job losses and reduced investment.
Earlier in the referendum campaign, those wanting to stay in the EU claimed the support of 36 FTSE 100 bosses - while employers group such as the CBI and EEF also back the UK's continued membership.
The debate around the economy has focused on the impact on the UK and its key industries of leaving the EU and what trade deals the UK will be able to negotiate when - as envisaged by Leave campaigners - the UK leaves the EU's single market.
The government has said leaving the EU will be a drag on economic growth and leave households thousands of pounds worse off than they otherwise would have been.
Leave campaigners have said this is scaremongering and now 110 business figures have signed a letter to the Evening Standard, arguing that far from damaging the City of London, exiting the EU would allow it to consolidate its position as the world's largest international financial centre.
Speaking in a ""personal capacity"", the signatories - including company chief executives, fund managers and economists - say they have a ""material interest"" in maintaining the City as a vibrant and competitive place to do business and warn the EU is going in the wrong direction and puts this at risk.
""The EU is now shackled to the euro, a project doing damage to the social and economic fabric of member countries, including high youth unemployment, "" they write.
""Meanwhile there is scant evidence that the EU will foster or support the kind of innovation which is essential if Europeans are to compete with the rest of the world.
How trade and the UK's economy are affected by membership of the EU.
""Specifically, we worry that the EU's approach to regulation now poses a genuine threat to our financial services industry and to the competitiveness of the City of London.""
They conclude: ""Assuming good political leadership and an effective regulatory environment, we believe that the City is most likely to strengthen its lead as the world's largest international financial centre, and continue to make a major contribution to the UK economy and employment, outside the EU but with continued access to its capital markets.""
Britain Stronger in Europe said Leave supporters had ""given up"" trying to sound credible on the economy amid the overwhelming evidence that the UK would get a ""worse deal"" if it left the EU's internal market.
Just hours before Vote Leave released the letter, UKIP leader Nigel Farage - also a supporter of EU exit - warned the campaign group they risked losing the referendum unless the terms of debate were shifted from the economy to immigration.
He challenged them to hit their Remain opponents where they were ""weakest"" on the issue of ""open-door"" immigration but questioned the ability of the senior Conservatives to do this given the government's record on failing to reduce migration levels.","More than 100 business figures have thrown their weight behind the campaign to leave the EU, arguing the City would ""thrive and grow"" outside the EU.",36173263
775,"The Royal Zoological Society of Scotland staff and conservationists have found the tubs handy for catching and handling feisty voles.
""Sometimes they can be a bit nippy,"" said Roisin Campbell-Palmer, of RZSS, referring to the mammals' bite.
RZSS is involved in vole conservation projects in England and previously worked on one in the Trossachs.
Ms Campbell-Palmer and vet Simon Girling give a sample number of water voles a health check before groups of the animals, which have been reared in captivity, are released into wetlands in England.
To catch the voles for their medical, the snack tubes are laid in their enclosure and the mammals are drawn to the dark tunnels.
Ms Campbell-Palmer said: ""The tubes also make it easier to weigh the voles.""
For the Trossachs Water Vole Reintroduction Trial water voles were bred at the Edinburgh-based society's Highland Wildlife Park at Kincraig, near Aviemore.
Numbers of voles in the Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park had been in decline because of predation by non-native American mink.
Other conservation projects have also been successful in boosting water vole numbers.
In 2014, water voles were recorded in a part of the Highlands for the first time in 20 years.
The population was spotted at RSPB Scotland's Insh Marshes reserve in Badenoch and Strathspey.
The charity said it believed efforts to eradicate mink had helped to encourage the return of the rare animals.
In 2011, ecologists recorded for the first time water vole populations in the Beinn Eighe National Nature Reserve in Torridon.

776,"""I've never met a man who's been less impressed by becoming heavyweight champion of the world,"" said Hearn, after seeing Anthony Joshua dismantle Charles Martin in two rounds and take possession of the IBF title.
Promoter Hearn seemed almost put out - 20,000 screaming fans at London's O2 Arena, a reported £1m purse with a promise of many millions more to come and an opponent who turned up in fancy dress. What more did the British fighter want?
He even seemed irritated that his new belt kept falling over. ""He's not used to those yet,"" said Hearn. On the evidence of Saturday's fight, he soon will be.
""I just don't want to make a big deal out of it,"" said the 26-year-old Londoner, having just won a world heavyweight title in only his 16th professional fight.
""I knew what I was here to do. I knew I wasn't losing. I spoke to someone on the phone the other day and said: 'Is it bad that I'm thinking about my post-fight speech already?'
""So what do you expect? When I retire on top I'll be happy.""
History suggests Joshua is adopting the right stance. When American legend Mike Tyson beat Trevor Berbick in 1986 to secure his first world heavyweight title, fame and adulation had already spoiled him. By Tyson's own admission, he was riddled with gonorrhoea that night. No wonder he looked so angry.
Joshua disposed of Martin 63 seconds faster than Tyson disposed of Berbick. Joshua won a world title 12 fights faster than Tyson. Fingers crossed Joshua's career takes far longer to unravel - and that he's not spotted driving around with a tiger in his passenger seat any time soon.
""When was the last time in heavyweight boxing we had a role model young children want to be like?"" said Hearn. ""At Monday's public workout, he stayed for an hour and a half to sign autographs. He did another hour after the weigh-in and another hour after the fight. That's how he feels fans should be treated.
""If your son said, 'I want to be like Anthony Joshua', you'd be pleased with that. If he said, 'I want to be like Tyson Fury', what would you say?""
The laughter from the press pack told Hearn everything he needed to know.
But Hearn isn't stupid. He wants Fury to carry on being naughtier than ever so that, when the time comes, he can promote the fight as good versus bad, sensible versus daft - however you want to frame it.

And anyway, Joshua isn't as nice as all that. For one, he's got a right hand that could fell an American fridge-freezer, never mind Charles Martin. And he knows full well that the British public wants a little bit more than a megawatt smile, some humble patter and the odd appearance on a panel show.
When Hearn was informed of Fury's assessment of Joshua's latest victory - Manchester's WBA and WBO champion called his rival ""slow and ponderous"" - the promoter, as promoters do, sounded indignant. But Joshua - who has plenty of the street about him, don't worry about that - gently steamed.
""Why should I lower myself to Tyson Fury's level? He should act like a champion, but he acts like a kid. You see what an eight-pack and some muscles can do, knock out a champion in two rounds. Maybe he should take some tips.
""I'm here to knock people out. That's what people want to see. People come to see blood and I've got no problem drawing blood for people. I enjoy it.""
Suddenly, the heavyweight division, for so long so lukewarm, is beginning to bubble again: Joshua clattering through the ranks like a bowling ball through skittles; Fury with his ring cunning and air of malevolent mischief, affected or not; David Haye on the comeback trail; WBC champion Deontay Wilder, 'The Trap from Tuscaloosa' who can also hit a bit, holding up the American end.
""I'm not saying Fury or Haye are next, but they're certainly on the radar,"" said Hearn. ""We're not going to wait two or three years to fight them. The pressure will be on us [from the British public] after a voluntary defence or two.
""And it's about time we cracked the American market. The big money is in the UK nowadays but we'd like some more money from our friends in America. The plan is to turn AJ into a pay-per-view fighter over there. Showtime and HBO both texted me within two seconds of Joshua's fight, saying: 'Let's talk.'""
Hearn also confirmed that the first battle between Joshua and Fury could take place at opposite ends of the country. Hearn said he had Wembley Stadium booked for Joshua's next fight on 9 July before Fury announced his rematch with Wladimir Klitschko would take place on the same date in Manchester.
Both men fighting different opponents on the same night seems like madness. But madness is Fury's stock in trade, while Hearn appears to revel in it.
""Sky turned down the Fury-Klitschko fight [which will be on subscription boxing channel BoxNation] because they didn't want to make a decision until Joshua had fought. They see AJ as the future,"" said Hearn.
""Sky are keen to go head to head with Fury-Klitschko. Fury did well beating Klitschko but it was an awful fight. When you see AJ fight, you get value for money.""
Who knows how that little bit of nonsense will be solved. Sky might see Joshua as the future, but fighting a relative unknown when Fury is fighting a legend on the same night seems foolhardy, however bad the first fight between Fury and Klitschko was.
And with New Zealand prospect Joseph Parker fighting Carlos Takam in May, Bulgaria's Kubrat Pulev fighting Britain's Dereck Chisora in the same month and Cuba's Luis Ortiz fighting Alexander Ustinov this summer, there aren't many decent names available.
But rest assured, Joshua is up for pretty much anyone. He'd fight King Kong, if only the British Boxing Board of Control would grant him a licence.
""Me, Fury, Haye, Wilder, we have to fight, it's bound to happen. We can't go through this whole era dodging each other. That would be silly.""
Far sillier things have happened in boxing, but Joshua at least sounds like he means it. And even if Joshua doesn't seem too excited about the ride ahead, you will be.
A few years ago, I asked Nigel Benn whether he thought Chris Eubank Jr would struggle to bear the burden of his famous name.
""It's very worrying because he has a lot to live up to,"" said Benn, a former two-weight world champion who fought two classic matches against Chris Eubank Sr in the 1990s.
""Chris Sr was a great fighter, so he's going to have so much pressure on him. If he jumps into the ring like his dad and has the same music, then he better perform like his dad.""
So it was intriguing to see Benn's son, Conor, make his professional debut on Saturday. Decked out all in black like his dad. Boxing out of the same wide crouch as his dad. Exhibiting the same jerky head movement as his dad. Scrapping like his dad.

777,"Two men have been arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences, reports said.
Authorities said the men were ""involved in recruiting, facilitating, and funding people to travel to Syria to engage in hostile activities"".
Australia is working to stop people joining Middle East jihadist groups.
The two men, aged 21 and 31, were arrested at the iQraa Islamic Centre south of Brisbane.
Both would be charged with preparing for incursions into Syria, Australian reports said. The 21-year-old would be charged with recruiting fighters to join the conflict, while the 31-year-old would be charged with providing funds to militant group Jabhat al-Nusra.
The men were not suspected of planning attacks in Australia, a federal police spokesman said.
Witnesses said that police arrived early on Wednesday morning with a locksmith to access the centre, which sells books, gifts and clothing, according to Fairfax Media.
The Australian Broadcasting Corporation said police also raided a gym in the same area.
It reported that one of the centre's founders is believed to be the brother of Abu Asma al Australi, who is suspected of being the first Australian suicide bomber to die in Syria.
But an iQraa employee denied that the Islamic centre and the two men were linked to terrorism.
He told ABC that the arrests happened because of the authorities' ""paranoia"" and security concerns for the G20 summit, due to be held in Brisbane in November.
A customer also told the AAP that the two men were ""born and bred"" Australians and the centre is ""harmless"".
Authorities have previously said that 100 or more people in Australia were ""actively supporting"" militant groups fighting in the Middle East.
The raid took place a day after the head of the Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation, David Irvine, said he was assessing whether to raise the threat level.
Australia has been at ""medium"" since the threat level system was introduced in 2003, according to the country's national security website.
""Medium"" means an attack could occur. It is followed by ""high"", which means an attack is likely and is the second highest threat level.
Mr Irvine told the ABC that the threat had been building in Australia over the past year and he had an ""elevated level of concern"".
He said this was due to ""the numbers of people we are now having to be concerned about in Australia, because of the influence of Syria and Iraq on young Australians both in terms of going to those places to fight, but also in terms of what they are doing here in Australia with a potential intent to attack"".
Officials have said that at least 60 Australians are believed to be fighting with jihadist groups in Syria and northern Iraq, and 15 Australians have been killed so far from those conflicts including two suicide bombers.
Australia has moved to restrict citizens from travelling to certain areas to join militant groups, and is in the midst of installing counter-terrorism units and biometric screening at all international airports.","Police in Australia have raided an Islamic centre in Queensland, a day after the country's spy chief said he was considering upgrading the terror threat level.",29137910
778,"The US central bank was concerned about the impact of the referendum on financial markets, minutes from the meeting show.
Policy makers were also concerned about May's slow job growth.
The central bank decided to keep interest rates between 0.25% and 0.5% when it met last month.
""Members generally agreed that, before assessing whether another step in removing monetary accommodation was warranted, it was prudent to wait for additional data on the consequences of the UK vote,"" the minutes revealed.
""Most participants noted that the upcoming British referendum on membership in the European Union could generate financial market turbulence that could adversely affect domestic economic performance.""
May's surprising dip in the hiring rate also appeared to rattle members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).
The US labour market added just 38,000 jobs in May, the lowest number since September 2010.
""The minutes show there's more chance of pigs flying than us getting a US rate any time soon,"" said Luke Bartholomew of Aberdeen Asset Management.
""We can see clearly see that the Fed was worried that a Brexit vote could unsettle markets. It is safe to say the growth and risk sentiment shock from Brexit will keep the Fed on hold.""
A few members of the FOMC did raise concerns that keeping interests rates at such a low level for a prolonged period could become problematic.
""Some of them emphasized that, with labour market conditions and inflation at or close to the Committee's objectives, taking another step in removing monetary accommodation should not be delayed too long,"" the minutes said.
However Federal Reserve members also stressed the need for the US market to be able ""withstand a possible downward shock to demand"" if international economies wavered.
China's economy also raised some concern, as growth in the world's second largest economy slowed in the second quarter. Policy makers noted the ""continued uncertainty"" around the country's foreign exchange policy and the mounting levels of Chinese debt.

780,"Tracey Connelly, 33, was jailed in 2009 and let out on licence in 2013, but returned to prison for breaching her parole conditions this year.
Earlier this month, a Parole Board panel decided against directing her release.
A spokesman said she would be eligible for review within two years.
The spokesman added: ""The Parole Board is unable to comment on the specifics of any case due to the Data Protection Act.""
Connelly admitted causing or allowing her one-year-old son Peter's death soon after being charged, and spent more than a year on remand before being sentenced in May 2009.
She received a sentence of ""imprisonment for public protection"", which carries a minimum term after which prisoners can be considered for release.
When deciding whether to release a prisoner, the Parole Board considers the nature of their crime, their history, their progress in prison, any statements made on their behalf and reports from relevant professionals.
Peter Connelly died in Tottenham, north London on August 3 2007 at the hands of his mother, her boyfriend, Steven Barker, and their lodger, Jason Owen.
Barker was given a 12-year sentence for his ""major role"" in Peter's death.
Owen was jailed indefinitely with a minimum three-year term, but later on appeal that was changed to a fixed six-year term. He was freed in August 2011 but has since been recalled to prison.
Peter suffered more than 50 injuries despite being on the at-risk register and receiving 60 visits from social workers, police and health professionals over the final eight months of his life.

781,"Latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures show a 38% fall in money invested in the UK by foreign-owned firms between 2012 and 2014.
But the Cardiff economists said jobs and projects coming to Wales through inward investment are growing steadily.
They suggest Wales is outperforming the UK as it did in the 1980s and 90s.
Meanwhile, the value of exports from Wales has dropped by 8.6% over the last year - with the biggest drop involving trade with the European Union.
Cardiff Business School's Welsh Economy Research Unit has been tracking inward investment for many years.
UK government figures earlier this year revealed a record high of 101 investment projects in Wales in 2014/15, creating and safeguarding around 9,600 jobs.
Set against the latest UK ONS figures, the Cardiff economists say Wales ""might be performing quite strongly in attracting inward investment at a time when the UK is seeing some pressure on inward investment flows"".
INWARD INVESTMENT - WHY WALES?
Wooing inward investment to Wales  has been a policy of governments since World War II in London and Cardiff.
The Treforest Industrial Estate was one of the first visible examples. Since then many big international names like Ford and Sony have come to Wales and stayed for many decades.
As global economic patterns changed, others like Bosch, Hoover and Hitachi left Wales to produce elsewhere.
It was the move towards a Single European Market in the 1980s and 1990s that made the UK and Wales particularly attractive.
Shoppers in Europe were buying more and more consumer goods from Japan and companies like Panasonic, Sony and many others decided that it made sense to move production closer to customers and the European market.
Massive shake-up
For them, the easiest place to do that from was the English-speaking UK.
Wales was going through a massive shake-up with many thousands of workers losing jobs in the traditional industries like coal and steel and so Wales could supply a large number of semi-skilled workers, flat land for industrial parks and significantly generous grants.
In return, many thousands of Welsh workers found employment and in some cases the foreign-owned firms brought new technology and different ways of working, which were later embraced by Welsh firms.
Between 1980 and 1995 Wales performed well at attracting inward investment. By 1992, it was winning 11.8% more than twice its share of the projects invested in the UK.
But by the mid-1990s that had halved (5.6%) and by 2005 that, in effect, halved again (2%).
In recent years, Wales has been winning greater proportions of inward investment again. Despite having only 5% of the UK's population, Wales in 2013/14 won 7.9% of the inward investment projects.
In terms of exports, those to the EU from Wales fell by 17% during the last year, according to new regional trade figures.
Countries where export values rose the most were the United Arab Emirates (up £80m, 7.2%) and Mexico (up £48m, 168%).
But the United States is still Wales' biggest trading partner - accounting for nearly a quarter of all exports, worth £2.9bn.
Wales' export trade with Ireland fell by more than a third in value or £591m.
The closure of the Murco oil refinery last November is reflected in the £1.1bn drop in exports of fuel products.
With the continuing problems inside the Eurozone, it is no surprise that businesses exporting there are feeling the impact, writes BBC Wales business correspondent Brian Meechan.
The US has always been a big market for Wales, more so than some other nations and regions in the UK.
Many businesses try to export to numerous different nations, the hope being that, if sales aren't going well somewhere because a country's struggling with growth, it will be mitigated by trade elsewhere.
As for imports, these fell 4% over the year although the biggest jump was in goods from China (up £86m). Germany remains the largest import partner for Wales and the EU now accounts for half of imports.","Wales appears to be bucking the trend in terms of attracting investment from overseas, according to analysis for BBC Wales by Cardiff Business School.",34996851

Begley carried out the attack in the Wetherspoons Winter Gardens pub in Parliament Street on 1 November.

783,"The government introduced a cap on sums paid to locum workers, but it can be breached by NHS bosses if they consider there is ""significant risk"" to patient safety.
The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) said it exposed ""poor workforce planning"" but said trusts had put safety first.
NHS Improvement said the cap had saved £300m.
The cap was introduced in response to a ""very significant financial challenge"" facing NHS providers, the health watchdog Monitor, part of NHS Improvement, said.
When the rules took effect Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said staffing agencies had been able to ""rip off the NHS by charging extortionate hourly rates"".
The cap, which came into force in November 2015, set a limit on hourly rates for agency doctors, nurses and other clinical and non-clinical staff.
They started at 150% on top of normal pay for junior doctors and 100% for other staff, before gradually being reduced to 55% across the board from 1 April 2016.
In the first week that the rules first took effect, beginning 23 November 2015, the clause was used 35,662 times between 228 hospital trusts.
This fell to 21,277 times in the week beginning 28 December. Since then use has risen, reaching 54,419 uses in the week beginning 4 April 2016 and 53,644 in the week beginning 11 April, the last week of figures released.
The figures released by Monitor under the Freedom of Information Act suggest that, as the limit has come down, more staff have been affected.
The cap on pay for agency and locum staff was in response to hospitals ""over-spending"" on temporary workers.
The chief executive of NHS England, Simon Stevens, said in 2015 that he wanted to see the £1.8bn spent on agency and contract staff the year before turned into ""good, paying permanent jobs"". And he accused staffing agencies of ""ripping off"" the NHS.
Rising use of agency workers was partly down to hospitals putting more nurses on wards in the wake of the Stafford Hospital scandal, Mr Stevens said. The official report into the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust identified a key reason for inadequate care was a lack of nurses.
However, the Royal College of Nursing says the NHS has not taken on enough student nurses to meet demand, resulting in agencies filling the vacuum and charging more to do so.
The health regulator NHS Improvement said hospitals in England were 15,000 short of the required number of nurses.
Figures obtained by the BBC in February 2016 showed there were more than 23,000 nursing vacancies in the NHS in England, Wales and Northern Ireland - about 9% of the workforce. That compares with a typical vacancy rate across all forms of work of 2.7%.
Details of each trust's use of the clause are recorded anonymously.
In the last week for which figures were available one hospital trust used the clause 1,310 times. Nursing, midwifery and health visitor staff made up 759 of those. Four other trusts also used the clause more than 1,000 times in the same week. Only 18 trusts did not use the clause at all in the week beginning 11 April.
Janet Davies, chief executive of the RCN, said: ""Agency cap breaches are a barometer of the scale of the NHS's workforce problem, and it shows clearly that the problem is getting worse.
""NHS Trusts are unable to recruit nurses and are rightly prioritising patient safety over sticking to the cap.
""This is a workforce planning issue. The number of nurses being trained in the UK has been reduced, for short-term financial reasons.""
A spokeswoman for NHS Improvement said the cap had saved up to £300m since October.
She added: ""We know that trusts will need to override the cap where patient safety is a concern and it's important that they are able to do that. But as the new rules set in, whilst overrides did increase temporarily, they have begun to steadily decline as we expected.
""Overuse of agencies is bad for patients, bad for the NHS and unfair on other staff. These measures will help those staff currently working in agencies to come back into the NHS. Average prices paid for agency nurses have fallen by around 11% since October, so NHS nurses can be assured that their agency colleagues aren't being paid over the odds for doing the same job.""
The biggest use of the clause came in a week when one of the junior doctors' strikes took place.
However, figures for other weeks when doctors were on strike in the long-running dispute over new contracts do not suggest a link as they were either less than the week before or rose in line with a general trend.","Rules on the amount hospitals can pay agency staff are being flouted more than 50,000 times a week, figures show.",36341285

Some 163,000 migrants applied for asylum in Sweden in 2015, the highest per capita number in Europe.
The numbers have fallen significantly since Sweden imposed tighter border controls this year.
Along with Germany, the Scandinavian country is a prime destination for refugees and other migrants entering the EU illegally.
Of the approximately 58,800 asylum cases processed in Sweden last year, 55% were accepted.
Of those facing expulsion, Mr Ygeman was quoted in Swedish media as saying: ""We are talking about 60,000 people but the number could climb to 80,000.""
But he later tweeted to say he had not taken a position on how many migrants had grounds for asylum, it being a matter for the authorities and the courts.
Sweden earlier this week became the latest of a number of European nations to see tensions over migrants heightened by violence. A 15-year-old asylum seeker was arrested in Molndal, near Gothenburg, after a 22-year-old asylum centre employee was stabbed to death.
Mikael Ribbenvik, head of operations at the Swedish Migration Agency, told the BBC that assessing all the asylum applications would be ""an enormous feat to accomplish"" and would require more resources from the government.
""A lot of people leave voluntarily and a lot of people abscond. And then we have a few people that are staying on that are impossible to remove because of identification purposes,"" he said.
More than one million refugees and migrants travelled to Europe last year, most fleeing conflicts in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.
The UN says another 46,000 people have arrived in Greece so far this year, with more than 170 killed making the dangerous crossing from Turkey.

Debates are won when one side manages to persuade more people than the other that their opinion is right.
This can be done by making strong points that the audience will remember, or finding problems with the other debaters' ideas.
Debates can happen everywhere, from classrooms and town halls, to the Houses of Parliament.

790,"Russia's communications regulator Roskomnadzor said LinkedIn would be unavailable in the country within 24 hours.
Some internet providers have already cut access to the site, which has more than six million members in Russia.
LinkedIn told the BBC it hoped to meet Roskomnadzor to discuss the block.
In 2014, Russia introduced legislation requiring social networks to store the personal data of Russian citizens on Russian web servers.
It is the first time the law has been enforced against a US-based social network.
Analysis by Sarah Rainsford, BBC correspondent in Moscow
The Kremlin says there's nothing to worry about, but Russian social network users fear that blocking LinkedIn is only a first step.
Many believe this ban is about censorship and control, not data protection. They're concerned that more popular sites such as Facebook and Twitter will be next.
One vivid cartoon shows the grim reaper, bearing the logo of Russia's communications regulator, heading for a door with the Facebook logo. Behind him lies a trail of blood from attacks on other sites.
Another user declares that the ban on LinkedIn marks ""a new era in mass censorship,"" while another fears that further restrictions will be creeping: ""They're like sadists, doing it bit by bit.""
Social media has played a critical role in organising opposition protests in Russia. Such sites have also become an increasingly important alternative source of information, as state control over traditional media has increased.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists in Moscow that Roskomnadzor was acting strictly in accordance with Russian law.
He added that the Kremlin had no intention of intervening in the situation.

792,"""These are brigadeiros, a traditional sweet in Brazil,"" she explains.
The 34-year-old sells the delicacies through her business, My Sweet Brigadeiro. She launched it in 2011, a few months after moving to the Big Apple from Rio de Janeiro.
At the other end of the long, steel table from Ms Barbosa's brigadeiros is a completely different type of food preparation. Three women, led by Isabel Gunther, are tossing vegetables in with stringy, white rice noodles in large bowls.
These will be packaged for healthy school meals, part of Ms Gunther's business, Little Green Gourmets.
Both firms are renting space and facilities at a kitchen incubator called Hot Bread Kitchen (HBK), based in the East Harlem neighbourhood of Manhattan.
In a food-obsessed city, where alternative commercial space is expensive, such incubators are continuing to play a vital role in helping culinary start-ups get off the ground.
Since opening its doors in 2011, HBK has now assisted 100 small firms, who can also take advantage of business support.
Ms Barbosa sells most of her chocolates online, and in a few select food markets.
She was at one of those markets in 2011 when her brigadeiros got a favourable review from the New York Times. As a result, orders came flooding in.
""It was crazy - we were a fad and we weren't ready,"" says Ms Barbosa. ""We didn't even have a credit card machine and we were saying 'yes' to everybody. So we decided to rent kitchen space and do this the proper way.""
Today, she says orders remain strong. Her bestseller is a box of 30 brigadeiros, which retails for $52 (Â£34).
HBK is also a business in its own right, founded by Jessamyn Rodriguez. It employs 50 people working across a bakery business and the incubator section. Its breads are sold at Whole Foods and other retailers and markets in New York.
""We run a thriving, growing, 24-hour bakery business out of the same space,"" says Ms Rodriguez.
""And that's inspiring for entrepreneurs, to see this constant production and delivery schedule. They get the message that if all goes well, they could end up like this.""
The HBK incubator charges a $500 annual fee for members, who can then rent kitchen space for $17 per hour, and access business counselling services on topics such as pricing structure and internet sales.
Entrepreneurs also get to network, which creates a collaborative community, says Ms Rodriguez.
Grace Moore, HBK's communications manager, adds that the incubator has a specific criteria for which food start-ups it accepts.
""We take in businesses with a proven idea, ready to grow,"" she says. ""When they've been producing and selling for a year, and their kitchen at home is bursting at the seams, that's when we come in.""
Michael Schwartz runs the Organic Food Incubator (OFI), based in Long Island City, in the New York borough of Queens.
He launched the centre in 2011 to provide food start-ups with the facilities and advice he struggled to find when he launched his own business, BAO Food and Drink.
""When we started BAO in 2009 we had endless trouble,"" says Mr Schwartz. ""There was no-one to tell us how to get the product into a store, for example. The small food scene was very different [to how] it is now.""
He adds that the OFI offers ""everything from recipe development to making sure your label is legal"".
The centre now incubates 60 companies, with prices starting from $220 for five days.
Like any traditional business incubator, it has its share of successful  graduates - entrepreneurs who have developed their start-up successfully and left the incubator to expand further.
Ariel Glazer's drinks company Kombrewcha spent its first two years at the OFI before recently moving production to a facility in New Hampshire.
The business makes a fermented tea with an alcohol level of 2%.
He credits the incubator with giving him the time and space to get the product right before its commercial release.
""When you start a business you don't know what you're getting into, and if you need lots more time to develop the product it can kill your business,"" says Mr Glazer. ""By doing it through an incubator, you don't need to put up initial capital.""
To be able to meet ever growing demand, both Mr Schwartz and Ms Rodriguez plan to expand their incubator facilities. Meanwhile, other food incubators are popping up all over the city.
Mr Schwartz credits the growing popularity of the local food movement - people wanting to buy food that is grown and produced locally.
Ms Rodriguez says the fact that New York's food lovers are always on the lookout for the next big thing also makes a difference.
""There are a lot of hungry mouths here who are trend-driven and looking for the newest thing coming to the market,"" she says.
In New York, small food start-ups are big business.","In a busy, communal kitchen in New York, Paula Barbosa is carefully placing little spheres of chocolate, coated in nuts, into individual sections in a gold box.",30697412
793,"Both players were appearing in their first ranking final since the 2015 World Championship, as Murphy scrapped his way to a 4-1 advantage.
Bingham fought back, compiling a break of 91 to go 5-4 ahead after the first session and extending his lead to 7-6.
Murphy made breaks of 94 and a superb 120 to lead 9-8, Bingham levelled, but Murphy took the 19th frame for victory.
""It had the feel of a 9-9 in that neither of us were going to get away from the other one and shake each other off,"" Murphy told BBC Sport.
""At nine all you just have to think on your feet - I saw an opportunity for a long red in the green pocket and took it.""
Despite leading early on, world number seven Murphy struggled to find his rhythm and was pegged back by his opponent.
""I was lucky I had the 4-1 lead,"" he said. ""My head had gone at the interval and I was just happy to get out of the arena and go back to the hotel to regroup.""
The 33-year-old was much more fluent in the final session to pick up the sixth ranking title win of his career and the £100,000 winner's prize money.
World number two Bingham, 39, has suffered a disappointing season since beating Murphy 18-15 to win the sport's biggest prize at the Crucible last May and has failed to pick up a title so far.
""At 4-1 down I felt like I had someone else's cue or arm - I was all over the place,"" said Bingham.

Jackson, 25, converted all nine Ireland tries in Saturday's 63-10 thumping of Italy and also starred in open play.
""This window has allowed Paddy to put his hand up and say 'well, that shouldn't be an automatic choice',"" said the Ireland coach.
Sexton is expected to be fit for the France game in Dublin.
British & Irish Lions star Sexton, 31, has missed Ireland's first two Six Nations games because of a calf muscle injury.
Schmidt added: ""Johnny has proven that he can come straight back into a side and hit the ground running, and he's done that for us on other occasions.
""I think Paddy certainly learned a lot in South Africa through that summer series.
""He learned a lot in November as well, particularly in that game against New Zealand where he came under a lot of pressure and had to make some decisions with very little time and space.
""And then again last week he did very well to lead us back into the game. He kicked well again today.""
After last weekend's surprise opening defeat by Scotland, Ireland could afford no slip-ups in Rome and Schmidt was pleased by his team's display.
""It was a good performance. We looked after the ball well and asked a fair bit of the Italians defensively,"" added the Ireland coach.
After the concession of three first-half tries contributed massively to the Murrayfield defeat, Schmidt was pleased with his team's fast start at the Stadio Olimpico as they went on to score nine tries.
""The players felt that [they needed to make a statement]. We know how good they can be.""
Keith Earls and CJ Stander both scored two first-half tries to secure the Six Nations' first ever win bonus point with the flanker going on to complete a hat-trick - a feat later matched by replacement Craig Gilroy.
Schmidt was also delighted with centre Garry Ringrose's try-scoring display after the Leinster youngster's nervous first half at Murrayfield.
""I felt sorry for him in the first 20 or 30 [minutes] last week when he was in a Six Nations game for the first time and it probably freaked him a little bit,"" said Schmidt.
""But it's great that he built a bit of confidence from his second-half performance last week and I thought he was super today.""
Jamie Heaslip, who captained Ireland after Rory Best was ruled out by illness, felt the victory margin flattered the visitors as they notched four tries in the final 12 minutes.
""The final score put a nice shine on it,"" said the number eight.
Italy coach Conor O'Shea admitted they had faced a team ""better in every department than us"".
""It was a tough day,"" added the Italian boss, who played 35 times for Ireland.
""In the first 20 minutes we took a battering. We talked about Ireland's ability to hold the ball through the phases, and the first 20 minutes took a physical and mental toll on us.
""But we will never hang our heads. We have to get ready in one week's time and be focused for England at Twickenham.""

796,"Researchers say the creature, nicknamed the fairy possum, is suffering under a combination of logging, fires and climate change.
In a study, they argue that increasing the size of reserves would help the possum but would damage other species.
The research has been published in the journal Plos One.
There are estimated to be just 2,000 of the tiny Leadbeater's Possums left in the Central Highland forests of the state of Victoria - the only area where they are found.
The animals, ""about the size of a tub of margarine"", spend most of their lives living and nesting in hollowed out trees that are up to 200 years old.
""When fires burn in an old growth forest, it produces these big dead trees that the animal likes to nest in,"" said Prof David Lindenmayer from the Australian National University, and one of the authors of the new study.
""But fires in a young forest don't produce that pulse of old dead trees - the big problem now is that less that 1.1% of the entire forest estate is dominated by these big old trees and it used to be up to 60%.""
Major fires in Victoria in 2009 eliminated large numbers of the animals and their habitat.
The complex interplay of fire, rising temperatures and industrial timber felling may see the end of the ""fairy possum"" as it's sometimes called, within 20 years.
""In the past logging took out the big trees and created young forests, but to our horror we've discovered in the last few years that forests that regenerate after logging are significantly more likely to burn at much higher severity,"" said Prof Lindenmayer.
""So logging and fire are not independent - and climate change and fire are not independent either, with increasing temperatures, reduced rainfall, increased lightning and wind, we're seeing more fire in this system.""
In their new study, the authors argue that new reserves are needed and that priority must be given to the Leadbeater's Possum.
To ensure the best survival chances of all creatures in the region, would require a fundamental change, says Prof Lindenmayer.
""The price really is to move the logging industry into plantations and out of native forests,"" he told BBC News.
""These animals have survived for 20 million years without logging but over the past 50 years they have become critically endangered because of human interference with this ecosystem.""
""If we want to conserve all of these different animals we need to take logging out of the system.""
Prof Lindenmayer is at a loss to explain just how the species acquired its nickname.
""I never call it the fairy possum, I always call it Leadbeater's Possum, when you handle them they've got some real spunk, they'll bite and scratch that's their way of fighting off predators, so it is anything but fairy like!""

""I wouldn't say it was easy, I think we made it look easy,"" said Sinclair, who scored the second and third goals.
""I think every game is so hard and, just the way we played tonight, it probably looked like it was easy.""
Own goals by Evgeni Postnikov and Igor Shitov and a James Forrest strike helped towards a comfortable win for Brendan Rodgers' side ahead of Tuesday's second leg in Kazakhstan.
""It was a great night,"" Sinclair said. ""The boys did unbelievable. The scoreboard shows how well we did.
""We got the fifth, but we wanted more and we kept going for the sixth.
""As players, we love these nights. These are the nights you want to play in. The atmosphere's unbelievable.

Shitov was credited with Celtic's fifth goal after Leigh Griffiths' shot deflected into the net off the defender.
But Griffiths said: ""I'm going to claim it until somebody else tells me otherwise. Until somebody officially confirms it wasn't my goal, I'm going to claim it.""
Griffiths set up Sinclair's second goal against the Kazakh side they also beat in the third qualifying round last season and Forrest's low strike and said: ""It's a great scoreline for us.
""Last year, we struggled to overcome this tie. It was a last-minute penalty that put us through, but now you see the team's flying. It's a whole different team now. We look forward to Tuesday.

It followed an argument between two men which broke out on North Bridge, near the junction with High Street.
The 36-year-old was stabbed in the torso and taken to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. The attacker ran off in the direction of Princes Street.
The suspect is described as black, in his 40s or 50s, about 6ft 5ins tall with a large build. He had short, greying black hair and spoke with an African accent.
He is believed to have been wearing a shirt and jeans.

799,"But the little pink tablets, to be sold under the brand name Addyi, have proven controversial. Here is what you need to know about what has been dubbed the ""female Viagra"".
That flibanserin - to use its chemical name - would draw comparison to its blockbuster male equivalent was inevitable but the nickname is misleading.
While a Viagra pill treats erectile dysfunction by improving blood flow to the penis, flibanserin was developed as an anti-depressant and boosts sexual desire by balancing chemicals in the brain.
Specifically, the drug treats hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), essentially a lack of libido that causes distress and is thought to affect between 5.5 million and 8.6 million US women.
By gaining approval, Addyi's makers Sprout succeeded where medical giants have failed.
Pfizer, Procter & Gamble and others have all tried to develop products treating low sexual desire in women.
While the product has its pros and cons, medical practitioners now have a new treatment available to treat a common condition.
Sprout plans to launch the product in mid-October. A rival, Palatin Technologies, has an alternative treatment for HSDD in late-stage trials.
Women taking the drug reported around one more sexually satisfying event a month, compared to a placebo.
But supporters say even this small benefit is worthwhile - ""I want to want my husband, it is that simple,'' said Amanda Parrish, one of the women involved in trials.
The FDA's approval of Addyi comes with tough safety measures, meaning that its usage is unlikely to be as widespread as with male Viagra.
Doctors will only be able to prescribe the drug after counselling patients about potential side-effects, including low blood pressure, nausea and fainting.
Pharmacists must remind patients not to drink alcohol while taking the drug, which can make the effects more severe.
And while Viagra can be taken shortly before having sex, Addyi must be taken daily.
""This is the biggest breakthrough in women's sexual health since the advent of 'the Pill' for contraception,"" The National Consumers League said in a statement.
Lobbying group Even the Score, which has campaigned for better treatment of women's sexual health, accused the FDA of gender bias, highlighting the numerous products available treating sexual dysfunction in men, although none of them treat low desire.
Some physicians have welcomed the approval too, such as Dr Lauren Streicher, associate professor of clinical obstetrics and gynaecology at Northwestern University.
""This is an enormous, enormous advance in women's health.
""Of all the sexual dysfunctions, this is by far the most common in every single age category and we've had no options for women up until now.""
Addyi's critics argue that the FDA has approved a drug of marginal impact with potentially serious side-effects. Previous versions of the drug have been rejected by the FDA.
""Unfortunately, we haven't heard the last of this drug,"" warned consumer group Public Citizen.
PharmedOut, which focuses on marketing in pharmaceuticals, said the FDA has been swayed by ""a clever, aggressive public relations campaign"".
""This opens the way for drug companies to pressure the FDA through public relations campaigns to approve more bad drugs: It's bad news for rational drug approval,"" Adriane Fugh-Berman, a pharmacology professor and director of PharmedOut told the Washington Post.
The medical status of HSDD has been disputed, with some arguing that low libido in women cannot be treated in the same way as erectile dysfunction in men.
""Women's sexuality is very complicated. It's not a matter of just taking that pill, by the way, and then all of a sudden the lights go on,"" Judy Kuriansky, a clinical psychologist and certified sex therapist, told CNN.",The first drug to treat low sexual desire in women has received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval.,33984472
800,"The shortage of nurses worsened last year, with 17% of all London's registered nursing jobs vacant, up from 14% in 2014 and 11% in 2013.
The figure is much higher than the national average of 10%.
The Department of Health said it did not recognise the figures and London had 1,800 more nurses than a year ago.
The RCN said the new figures, which it gathered through Freedom of Information requests to all of London's NHS trusts, showed the city was facing a ""critical shortage"" of registered nursing staff.
A spokesperson said this put patients at risk and led to expensive solutions such as temporary agency staff or recruitment from overseas.
Bernell Bussue, the RCN's London regional director, said: ""The problem is partly down to short-sighted workforce planning which saw training posts cut in the past, meaning there aren't enough home grown nurses coming through the system.
""Most importantly, the ongoing pay freeze imposed by the government means that nursing staff increasingly just can't afford to live and work in London.

17% average vacancy rate
30% highest vacancy rate at an individual trust

Responding to the figures, London Mayor Boris Johnson told BBC Radio London ""you can afford to be a nurse and live in London"".
He added: ""I won't deny the cost of living in London is incredibly high.""
But he said the Conservative party has built record numbers of ""affordable homes"" and there are homes for part-buy, part-rent.
A spokeswoman for NHS England (London) said the July figures did not reflect reductions in agency spend since a cap on charges for agency staff was introduced in November.
""In London we are looking at new ways to recruit both new and returning nurses while retaining nurses already in post so that we are reaching our planned staffing levels,"" she said.
""This includes a programme in which senior nurses in the capital are working together to  create innovative career pathways and making London a more desirable place to work.""
A Department of Health spokesperson said: ""Official statistics show that Londoners have already benefitted from 3,400 additional nurses since May 2010 and this is down to continued government investment in the frontline.

801,"Ronaldo, 32, is said to want to leave Spain after being accused of tax fraud.
The forward, with the Portugal squad in Russia, signed a new five-year contract in November 2016, but has been linked with a return to Manchester United.
""The only thing I can say is Cristiano Ronaldo is a Real Madrid player,"" said Perez, who was re-elected on Monday.
Spanish prosecutors have accused Ronaldo of defrauding the authorities of millions of euros in tax, which he has denied.
""Obviously something has happened, something has affected him, his credibility,"" Perez told Spanish radio station Onda Cero. ""I'm sure he will tell us and we will see.
""It's no coincidence that he's in a very important tournament, the Confederations Cup. It hasn't finished yet and I don't want to disturb the Portuguese team.
""He just wants to be the best player in the world. If Cristiano wants to leave Real Madrid, it won't be for money.""
Perez said he is yet to receive an offer for Ronaldo - or striker Alvaro Morata or midfielder James Rodriguez, both of whom have also been linked with United.
""We want to keep all our players next season, including James,"" said Perez.
Speaking in a further interview with Spanish newspaper Marca, he added: ""Cristiano is a good guy as a professional and as a person. This is very strange and in the next few days I'll talk to him.
""I must defend him at all costs, both as a player and as a person. What I will say is that everyone must fulfil their tax obligations. I have no doubt that Cristiano will be able to defend himself.
""What they have told me is that he has the same financial arrangements as he had in England, where he had no problems.""
Ronaldo is said to be ""upset"" after being accused of tax fraud and wants to leave, a source close to the player told the BBC.
He is accused of evading tax to the value of 14.7m euros (£13m; $16m) between 2011 and 2014.
Real Madrid released a statement saying they had ""full confidence"" in their player, and they were convinced he would prove his innocence.
Ronaldo's discontent has alerted clubs all over the world but he has been linked most strongly with a return to United, or a transfer to PSG.
But the Portuguese would be costly - his Real contract has a 1bn euro (£874.88m) release clause.
In 2009, Perez - then in his second spell at the club - signed Ronaldo for Real for a then world-record fee of £80m.
The forward had helped United win three Premier League titles and the Champions League in his six years at the club, and had also won the Ballon d'Or.
He was presented at the Bernabeu in front of 80,000 fans, as Perez attempted to bring together a second group of 'Galacticos'.
Eight years on, Ronaldo has scored a club-record 406 goals in 394 appearances.
Only two weeks ago, he helped Real win their 12th European Cup, scoring twice in a 4-1 victory over Juventus in the Champions League final in Cardiff.
Victory meant Real became the first team to win back-to-back Champions League titles, with Ronaldo the competition's record goalscorer with 105.
A two-time La Liga winner, his 285 goals in 265 league appearances mean he is second only to Barcelona's Lionel Messi in that competition.
He won the Ballon d'Or award for a fourth time in December and signed a new deal with Real in November, saying he could continue playing for another 10 years
BBC Sport's Simon Stone
It was billed as Florentino Perez addressing the Ronaldo issue, but when Real Madrid's newly re-elected president gave a round of media interviews, the content was much the same - effectively 'I don't know what is going on'.
He did say Ronaldo is under contract, but everyone knows that. He also said he needed to speak to the Portuguese but, with the Confederations Cup in Russia under way, now was not a good time.
This was a politician's way of addressing a hot topic. Talking but saying nothing.
It merely adds to the air of uncertainty. Does Ronaldo really want to leave Real, or is he angling after a better deal?
Does he want to move back to Manchester United or is his preference Paris St-Germain?
For all the words written and spoken about the four-time Champions League winner, the only people who really know are Ronaldo himself and long-time adviser Jorge Mendes.
They will have the final say. And the wait may be a long one.

""The old homepage was targeted at getting people to sign up for an account or download the app,"" said David Wilkinson, managing partner at digital consultancy Soho Strategy.
""This is a bid to expand its appeal beyond the registered users, and get people to engage with content regardless of whether they're signed in.

Previously, the website's homepage outside the US and Japan displayed only a large photograph and a log-in panel, without indicating what registered users could do or see on the website.
""It shows Twitter's recognition that an algorithmic way of curating content, like on Facebook, is something that might interest people,"" said Mr Wilkinson.

804,"Harambe, a western lowland gorilla, was killed at Cincinnati Zoo earlier this year after a three-year-old boy fell into his enclosure.
On Wednesday, Philadelphia Zoo said it would allow the public to vote on a name for the newborn.
Social media users quickly swamped the zoo with thousands of messages.
The newborn is the same subspecies - Gorilla gorilla gorilla - as Harambe.
Zookeepers, however, said the name will be put to a public poll from a selection chosen by staff members.
There has been no confirmation that Harambe will make that shortlist and the competition has not even opened yet.
That, however, has not stopped thousands of calls for the name online.
Philadelphia Zoo said they were ""amazed and humbled"" by the ""outpouring of support and genuine excitement"".
The newborn's sex is still unknown, as the baby is being held close by its mother, Honi.
Zookeepers said staff will make suggestions once they know if it is a boy or a girl - and rely on the public to vote from those choices in the coming weeks.
""We are very excited to welcome Honi's new baby,"" said Dr Andy Baker, the zoo's Chief Operating Officer.
""This birth is an opportunity to engage our visitors in caring about the future of gorillas in the wild.""
Harambe's death in May this year, accompanied by sensational video footage of the three-year-old child in danger, made international headlines.
In the wake of the shooting, many questioned the need for killing the animal, despite the keepers at Cincinnati Zoo insisting they had no choice.
That led to a wide range of internet memes and an online campaign of ""Justice for Harambe"", which later became a joke in online circles.
The zoo itself said it was ""not amused"" by the online jokes and closed its Twitter account, after months of Harambe references being posted in response to every tweet.",Philadelphia Zoo has been inundated with suggestions to name its newborn baby gorilla Harambe after launching a naming contest.,37243016
805,"About 300,000 people in Northern Ireland are deaf or have hearing difficulties.
And an organisation that supports them is pressing for sign language legislation, making it a top priority in the general election campaign.
It is something that the British Deaf Association has demanded since 2001.
On Wednesday night, the organisation held a hustings in Belfast, with dozens of people attending the Question Time style event with the five main Northern Ireland parties.
Sign language interpreters were on stage to translate for deaf audience members, and a translator spoke on behalf of deaf people who wanted to ask a question.
Some of the deaf people at the event said that when parties come to their door to canvass, there's no way for them to engage.
That's because parties don't have sign language interpreters with them, nor British sign language interpretations of their manifestos.
British Deaf Association member Brian Symington told the hustings that sign language was a ""language of need"".
It deserved legislation to be prioritised over an Irish or Ulster-Scots act, he said, as many people who use it learn it through necessity rather than choice.
After the event, Colette Blair and Eamonn McCaffrey, who are both deaf, spoke to the BBC with the help of a sign language translator.
Colette said a sign language act, similar to what has already been introduced in Scotland, would ""transform"" her life and the lives of other deaf people.
""In education settings, in terms of access to the curriculum and if we want to have interpreters for meetings, we need to know what's going on,"" she said.
""Speaking as a mum who's tried to work for my child going through the system, we need to have it in law.""
Eamonn, who teaches sign language, said he wants to see it taught in schools.
""Everyone learns German and French but they never use it again in their life,"" he said.
""People who would learn sign language here would have the opportunity to use it and speak to deaf people here in Northern Ireland.""
Both Colette and Eamonn said the hustings was their only real chance to engage in debate around the general election.
""My neighbours talk to each other about politics - I don't get the chance to just chat to people, that's why tonight's so important,"" said Colette.
Wendy Newbrauner is a mum of three children who are all deaf, and she said it's been a real struggle for her family.
""The parties need to look at how to make lives easier for parents of deaf children,"" she said.
""It is a continuous fight to access services and support that are vital for their everyday lives and to make their lives easier.""
Eamonn added that he and others like him are prepared to keep fighting to make sure sign language gets the recognition it deserves.
""We are a determined people - we will keep going.
""We have to think of the future generations coming through - they need a better future.""
Facing a third election in 13 months, the TUV is feeling ""the pinch in terms of finances"", according to leader Jim Allister.
His decision to field a single candidate in this election was a strategic one, with one eye firmly on the future.
""There's the prospect of another assembly election in the autumn, so strategically we decided we'd preserve some of our resources for that,"" said Mr Allister.
""We're fighting in our heartland of North Antrim - I regret that we're not fighting wider than that.""
Mr Allister was on the campaign trail with Ulster Unionist Tom Elliott in Fermanagh and South Tyrone this week, and in spite of his rasping criticism of the party in the past he saw no contradiction in joining its canvass.
That's because the battle for the constituency is on a ""knife-edge"".
""Not just unionists but democrats would want to see the election of somebody who's prepared to do the job and do it well as Tom Elliott has already done,"" he said.
""My presence there was a conscious demonstration of unionist unity in support of an agreed unionist candidate, far in preference to the return of somebody who wouldn't even go to represent the people.
""That's what abstentionism is - it's claiming to be an MP but doing it under false pretences.""

806,"Multiple world champion Lampkin will need to navigate more than 200 corners on his back wheel and climb 1,385 ft (422 m) above sea level.
Lampkin and his team of engineers have spent six months developing a specially modified machine for the challenge.
The Skipton rider said it would not be possible on a standard trial bike.
Lampkin's engineering team led by Francesco Romani and Blackie Holden have based the machine on a Vertigo Combat Ice Hell - 300cc Fuel injected single cylinder two-stroke machine.
The team have made modifications to the brakes, suspension, fuel consumption and gear box.
The changes include the addition of a small electric motor fitted to the hub to keep the front wheel spinning throughout the challenge.
Media playback is not supported on this device
The team said it is needed to allow the bike to be steered despite the front wheel being aloft for more that two hours.
They have also removed the front brake as it is not needed and the workings of the front forks to save weight.
Work has also been carried out to optimise fuel consumption and changes made to the gearbox which will mean that the majority of the TT course can be ridden in one gear.
Lampkin, who has won five consecutive World Indoor and seven consecutive World Outdoor Championships, said it will be one of his ""toughest ever challenges.""
The 40-year-old from North Yorkshire added that it will ""push him and his machine to the absolute limit"".

807,"In this business of the pantheon, there is, of course, Richie McCaw on 148 New Zealand caps, then Australia's George Gregan on 139, Brian O'Driscoll on 133 and All Black, Keven Mealamu, on 132. Given that his coach, Gregor Townsend, has said that Ford could play on at international level for at least another two years, you start doing the mental arithmetic.
Two injury-free years? There's the 2017 autumn Tests [three more caps], the 2018 Six Nations [another five], the summer tour that follows [add three], an autumn series [add three more] the 2019 Six Nations [plus five] and the World Cup in Japan [throw another five on top]. Fair enough, it's stretching things, but that little lot would send Ford rocketing into the top 10 caps-winners in history.
It is put to him, as he looks over Lami Bay in Fiji, that at the age of 33, and looking after himself the way he looks after himself, that there are a lot more caps out there for him. ""I'm actually 32,"" he replies.
This, it has to be said, is a surprise. Every available online source says Ford was born on April 23, 1984, which would make him 33, and that at the age of 20 he made his Scotland debut against Australia in 2004, which would also make him 33. Upon consultation, the Scottish Rugby media team believe him to be 33. When asked, the Scottish rugby manager, Gavin Scott, says he reckons the hooker is 33, but that he has a photograph of his passport on his phone so he can check. That also says Ford is, indeed, 33.
The only person in Fiji who believes Ross Ford isn't 33 is Ross Ford. So on Thursday evening he's asked again.
""Ross, what age, are you?""
""I'm 32.""
""You're not. You're 33.""
""Am I? Ah, OK. It's only a number.""
This story cuts to the heart of Ford, a man who just gets on with life without fuss or bother, without getting too high or too low, without concerning himself with incidentals such as his age.
He says that the whole record thing ""creeped up on him"". He never gave it any thought until people started asking. You talk about his international career span of 13 years and he says he can't remember a whole lot about it. Bits and pieces, yeah. But not much.
That first cap? ""I was pretty nervous. I can remember the lineouts hadn't gone too well during the week and I was a little bit terrified to be honest."" He'd come off the bench for Gordon Bulloch. As an illustration of how long ago it was, the Scotland full-back that day was Stuart Moffat [Ford thought it was Chris Paterson] and the Scottish blindside flanker was Scott Gray [Ford guessed it was Jason White].
""I enjoy it a lot more now,"" he says, before talking about what all of this means to those around him. ""My mum and dad and my brother, my girlfriend, they're all very proud. I take it as is, but it's good for them to be able to enjoy it. A lot of it is for them. They've all made massive sacrifices. Laura [his partner] is very good when I'm not playing well, she knows how to buck up my ideas and get us going. They all play an important part in my life and I'm lucky to have them.""
Ford had the fortune, and misfortune, to arrive on the international stage when he did. Fortune in that he went largely unchallenged as Scotland's pre-eminent hooker. The flip-side is that he went unchallenged in a team that found winning murderously difficult. A corner has been turned in recent years, but Ford was one of the few constants through the misery, the wooden spoons in the Six Nations, the near Shakespearean tragedy that was Scotland's back-play, the relentless negativity and lack of hope that must have tested his mental strength to the maximum.
Of the 55 Six Nations matches he has played he was won only 13. Five of those have come in the last two seasons. As first-choice, Ford may have been overtaken by Fraser Brown, but the fact is that he's now producing some of his best stuff in a Scotland jersey. He talks about this ""bunch of boys"" being the strongest squad he's been involved with. He says it in a way that tells you that he's not intending to ease-up any time soon.
Snapshots of the journey? His three biggest highs are listed as the win over Ireland at Croke Park in 2010, the win over Australia in Australia in 2012 and one of his Calcutta Cup wins - 2006 and 2008. Either will do, both were precious.
His lows are plentiful. The Six Nations wooden spoon of 2012 is number one, a season of horror that produced five losses and only four tries. In his day, there were two championships - 2008 and 2010 - when Scotland scored only three tries in their five games. If you're looking for an indication of how life has changed - and why he's enjoying it more now than he has ever done before - Scotland scored three tries in 80 minutes in their victory over the Wallabies in Sydney last Saturday.
He says Bismarck du Plessis of South Africa has been his toughest opponent - ""a big confrontational, physical boy. In your face the whole time."" For a man who doesn't lose his temper, a Test in Argentina in 2009 stands out as the angriest he has ever been on the field. ""Somebody tried to feign that I hit them and I was raging after that. It happened just 20 minutes in and the referee bought it. Wish I had hit him. I was completely innocent. That gave me added oomph in everything I did that day.""
His international coaches in a word - or three?
The most bonkers Scottish player in his time: ""Ryan Wilson - unbelievable. Brilliant fun, full of energy."" Greatest Scottish player: ""Mike Blair, definitely,"" he says of the former scrum-half and now national team skills coach. ""Spied a gap no problem. His knowledge of the game was outstanding. If they [Stuart Hogg, Finn Russell and the rest of the modern-day stars] get close to Mike then that's ideal for us.""
Ford talks about the All Blacks both as the greatest team he has ever played against and the one team he would most like to beat. He's had four cracks at them, all at Murrayfield - a 32-6 loss in 2008, a 49-3 pummelling in 2010, a 51-22 rout in 2012 and, in 2014, the closest of them all, a 24-16 defeat. Scotland were ahead with 10 minutes to go, but couldn't hold out. ""If you beat them then you've as near as damned played the perfect game. Beating them would be a career high. The closest we came was that last one. We've learned a lot since then, we've learned how to close out games. I'd like to think that the team now would close that game out.""
He says the biggest lesson of all is just to enjoy what he has, to savour it for as long as it lasts. ""There's no point in worrying. In a professional environment you can get stressed out and things can overwhelm you a bit, but once you get a little bit older you should be enjoying everything about it. It's been a massive privilege to play this game.""
Ford, famously, doesn't say a lot, but, in many ways, he doesn't have to. Thirteen years and 109, going on 110, caps says enough. He's done a lot, but the way he sees it, he still has a lot left to do.",It was during a discussion about the most capped rugby players of all time that Ross Ford produced one of the most Ross Ford moments of his 109 and soon to be Scottish record-breaking 110-cap career.,40376288

809,"So the European Commission ruling - that the country should recover up to €13bn (£11bn) from Apple in back taxes - is a serious blow.
It is damaging in two ways: It hits the Republic's international reputation and it could make it less attractive as a destination for foreign direct investment (FDI).
Tax has been a key part of Ireland's success in attracting investment, particularly from US technology firms.
The 12.5% corporation tax rate is among the lowest in the developed world.
Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan makes no apologies for that rate, saying:  ""We do not hide it, in fact, we broadcast this rate as the defining element of our corporate taxation system.
""The Irish tax regime is fully transparent as our rules are clearly laid down in statute.""
But aside from that headline rate Ireland has, on occasion, appeared very accommodating to the tax-planning needs of multinationals.
'Double Irish'
Most notoriously there was the ""double Irish"" structure which allowed multinationals to legally shift profits from Ireland to countries that are considered tax havens.
It worked by allowing one Irish-registered subsidiary to make payments, for using intellectual property, to another subsidiary which is tax resident in a country like Bermuda or the Cayman Islands.
Mr Noonan closed that scheme to new entrants in 2015 and it will be phased out by 2020.
So expect Irish ministers to emphasise the efforts they have made to close down loopholes.
At the same time, they will have to reassure companies that they will not be the next to face a huge tax bill based on historical arrangements.
There are also some tricky domestic politics in Dublin.
The minority centre-right government will appeal the ruling, in effect saying it does not want the money.

810,"In spring, there was a surge in calls about people taking the substance that is said to ""zombify"" users.
Dr Oliver Sutcliffe, a chemist at Manchester Metropolitan University, said the increased potency was probably due to a ""manufacturing error"".
He said the compound had caused ""similar catatonic states"" in New York.
""The potency of the products that were seen in Brooklyn matched the same levels of potency that we were seeing in Manchester samples,"" said Dr Sutcliffe, who is a lecturer in psychopharmaceutical chemistry.
""We think this has arisen through a manufacturing error on the part of the drug manufacturers rather than being put into the sample specifically to increase the potency.""
A blanket ban on previously-called legal highs - also known as new psychoactive substances - came into force in the UK in May 2016.
They include spice, which is usually a brand name for synthetic cannabinoids that mimic the effects of cannabis.
""Synthetic cannabinoids have been chemically designed in a laboratory to be more effective [than natural cannabis]... therefore you are producing a much more profound effect at significantly lower doses,"" Dr Sutcliffe said.

The Shia group's advance on the capital has left scores dead this week and damaged many key buildings.
The showdown between the Houthis and forces loyal to the main Sunni party, Islah, has triggered Yemen's worst crisis since 2011.
The violence came as it emerged that a deal between the rival groups was under discussion.
One presidential source told a BBC Arabic correspondent in Sanaa that the Houthis - an armed Shia grouping - had signed a draft agreement proposed by President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi.
No confirmation was available, and details of any discussions were limited.
Much of the violence on Saturday was in the northern part of the capital, where the rebels tried to seize control of the Iman University from fighters loyal to Islah.
The capital's international airport remained closed for a second day. Hundreds have fled their homes.
Following serious clashes between armed groups on Thursday and Friday, hundreds of Yemenis have had to leave their homes. Many others are stranded in their houses unable to go out and buy food and supplies.
""Most of the neighbourhood has left and most shops have closed,"" says Samir al-Miqbaly, a small grocery owner near the headquarters of Yemen TV, the state broadcaster, where clashes have taken places for the past two days.
""The sounds of shelling are very strong and the fighting is so intense that we could feel our houses shaking.""

814,"Mental health problems affected everyday activities such as budgeting and paying bills, the Money and Mental Health Policy Institute (MMHPI) said.
Setting spending limits on cards and allowing people to set how banks contacted them would help, it said.
The trade body for High Street banks has vowed to improve inclusion.
In its mission statement covering 2016-18, the British Bankers' Association (BBA) said that the ""crucial part of the industry commitment to raising standards"" should include working with mental health initiatives.
The MMHPI said one in four people could suffer from mental health issues in any one year. It has published research suggesting that periods of poor mental health put people at risk of financial trouble.
For example it found that people with depression or post-traumatic stress disorder were likely to struggle with short-term memory, making Pin numbers harder to remember.
Those experiencing bipolar disorder or ADHD often struggled to resist impulses, potentially leading to dramatic spending sprees, it said.
People with borderline personality disorder or psychosis could find it very difficult to compare financial options and found it more difficult to plan ahead.
Extreme anxiety could also stop people opening letters or taking calls from banks.
Dan, aged in his 40s, says his finances are affected by his bipolar condition and anxiety. This led to a phobia of opening letters and answering the telephone, fearing his ""safe space was being invaded"".
As a result, bills went unpaid and bank charges built up, leading to debts which he is still repaying after 15 years. ""I'm still playing catch-up,"" he says.
Although conditions are very individual, he says he would have been helped by correspondence through e-mail which would have allowed him to compartmentalise his financial matters and ""take away the emotion"" by dealing with it in work mode.
""Senior managers want to put measures in place, but this does not always filter down to branches and call centres,"" he says.
He would like to see better training in place. Clearer literature from banks, on what assistance is available for customers with mental health problems, would also allow people to make an informed decision on revealing their condition to bank staff.
The MMHPI is challenging banks to adapt some systems already available to help those with mental health problems. For example
Polly Mackenzie, the Institute's director, said: ""For too long, it has been assumed that when people with mental health problems get behind on bills, or struggle to stick to their budget, it is because they are lazy or incompetent. Our research proves beyond doubt that's just not true.
""Mental health problems can severely affect consumers' ability to stay on top of their finances, shop around, or manage a budget.
""It is time for the financial services industry to adapt its services to help support people when they are unwell - just as they do to help people with physical disabilities who struggle to access a branch or engage on the phone.""
A spokeswoman for the BBA said: ""The industry is committed to supporting customers in vulnerable circumstances, and will consider these recommendations carefully alongside the pioneering work already done with the Royal College of Psychiatrists and others on debt and mental health issues.
""It is vital that vulnerable customers are offered the right support, although we recognise that balancing this support with respect for customers' privacy is a difficult and sensitive issue.
""The industry is continually looking at ways to help vulnerable customers, and develop alternatives to make everyday banking arrangements easier, with useful information and suggestions on different types of payments a key part of these developments.""","Banks must offer basic account options, as given to other vulnerable people, to assist those struggling with mental health conditions, a think tank says.",38722210

These include ensuring adults in football have been checked to ensure they are eligible to work with youngsters and that they have received suitable safeguarding training.
The other measures are making sure concerns from both children and adults are listened to and that concerns about a child's welfare are reported.
Rooney said: ""It's important that everyone knows how to raise any concerns about a child's welfare.""
Meanwhile, ex-England captain Alan Shearer has said he has been ""shocked and deeply saddened"" by revelations of abuse in the game.
The former striker, who like Rooney is an ambassador for the children's charity NSPCC, said he understood ""the pain and lasting damage abuse can cause"".
The Match of the Day pundit added: ""I have nothing but huge respect and admiration for all the players who are now coming forward, bravely breaking years of silence in a bid to help others.

Meanwhile, ex-Southampton manager Lawrie McMenemy has told the BBC he would have taken immediate action if he had known of any abuse allegations during his time in charge between 1973 and 1985.
He said: ""Certainly if I'd known that was happening in my time - and I don't think it did happen in my time - I would have got it killed straightaway.""

He told the paper he had been abused as a youth player in the 1970s by Eddie Heath, who is now dead.
Football Association chief executive Martin Glenn said if there was any evidence of rules being breached - ""and hushing up would be one"" - it would apply its rules ""regardless of size of club"".
In a statement, Chelsea said: ""Chelsea Football Club has retained an external law firm to carry out an investigation concerning an individual employed by the club in the 1970s, who is now deceased.

But after the incident involving Northampton's George North in England's Premiership, officials could bring in a more comprehensive ""bespoke"" system.

""Pro12 Rugby is in discussion with several providers about implementing a bespoke video system to facilitate more comprehensive access to match footage for medical staff, team management and disciplinary and match official performance review at all 135 games.""
The use of video replays for reviewing head injuries is in focus after Wales winger North hit his head in Northampton's defeat by Leicester.
The 24-year-old fell heavily after a mid-air collision with Leicester's Adam Thompstone in their 19-11 defeat on 3 December.
The winger returned to action in that match after a head injury assessment, despite television replays showing him lying motionless on the pitch immediately after the tackle.
An investigation by the independent concussion review panel decided Saints will face no sanction over their handling of the incident.
However, the concussion review panel concluded North should not have returned to the field of play and emphasised the importance of video replays - and their monitoring - for medical staff.
North, meanwhile, will return to action on 23 December after an enforced break of nearly three weeks.
The Pro12 implemented World Rugby head injury protocols in 2014 and adopted the current Head Injury Assessment (HIA) along with the Six Nations following a trial period in August 2015.
The league claims that made them the first tournament to implement the regulations.
It also requires all players, coaches and medical staff to sign a document committing them to ensuring correct procedures are followed and undertaking ""mandatory online courses in concussion management"" as part of the participation agreement.
Head injuries are reviewed by a group which has disciplinary powers.
A Pro12 spokesman said: ""No matter how sophisticated the technology employed, such video systems will serve only as a tool to assist our medical personnel and doctors, who act to the highest standards and in the best interest of our players.
""We have a medical subcommittee comprised of members from our four territories of operation and this group is constantly establishing, reviewing and improving our protocols around player safety.""
Welsh Rugby Union chairman Gareth Davies says the decision not to punish Northampton was the correct one.
""It's raised the awareness once again,"" Davies told BBC Wales Sport.
""I think people in clubs and national governing bodies are doing the right thing for the players and I'm sure that would have been Northampton's intention, albeit some people would claim George should not have gone back on the field.""",The Pro12 is in talks to bring in a new video system to help medical staff review head injuries during all games.,38368860
818,"Ross Monaghan, 35, was shot in the back in a targeted attack at around 09:05 on Monday, 16 January.
He had dropped his child off at St George's Primary in Penilee when a man pushing an buggy pulled out a gun.
Police returned to the area one week on, to seek more information about the attack from parents of school children.
Between 25 and 30 uniformed and CID officers were outside the school and in Muirdykes Road between 08:00 and 09:00.
Det Ch Insp John Kennedy confirmed Mr Monaghan had left the country since the attack.
""We've briefly spoken to him but at this stage we have to re-interview him,"" he said.
""It's very difficult when he's in Spain at the moment.""
Ross Monaghan was cleared of killing gangland figure Kevin ""Gerbil"" Carroll in 2012 after a judge ruled there was no case to answer due to insufficient evidence.
After the shooting, images of the man thought to be the gunman were published by the Scottish Sun newspaper.
The man, who can be seen pushing a buggy near the school, was wearing a blue padded jacket, blue jeans, a dark woollen bobble hat and a woollen scarf pulled up around his face.
The suspect is also believed to have been in the area, outside the school, on Friday 13 January 2017, with the buggy.
Det Ch Insp John Kennedy said detectives were trying to establish if anyone witnessed the gunman running with the buggy from the scene.
He said: ""We don't think he went into a house in the Penilee estate.

819,"He called his visit to the USS Theodore Roosevelt ""a symbol"" of America's stabilising presence in the region.
Mr Carter said any concern over his visit was due to ""tension in this part of the world"", blaming China for ""most of the activity over the last year"".
His visit clearly irritated Beijing, a BBC correspondent in China says.
A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman warned against ""waving the banner of freedom of navigation to push forward the militarisation of the South China Sea and even provoke and endanger other countries' sovereignty and security interests"".
""In this aspect, we hope the relevant actions and intentions of the US can be made open and above board,"" she said before Mr Carter's visit.
The US defence secretary flew on Thursday with his Malaysian counterpart to the Theodore Roosevelt, which was sailing some 70 miles (112 miles) north-west of Borneo.
His visit comes a week after a US Navy destroyer sailed inside the 12 nautical mile radius that China claims as its territorial waters around one of its recently reclaimed islands.
Countries in and around the South China Sea have wrangled for centuries over control of the ocean areas and its, largely uninhabited, islands.
But tensions have increased in recent years as China has backed its expansive claims with island-building and navy patrols.
The US alleges China has reclaimed almost 3,000 acres of land in the past 18 months, and fears the dispute could turn into one with global consequences.","US defence secretary Ash Carter has visited an aircraft carrier in the South China Sea's contested waters, in what is seen as a signal to China.",34737051
820,"The protesters, who are made up of students and supporters of the Occupy Central pro-democracy movement, want a free choice of candidates for the vote in 2017 but Beijing has ruled that option out.
BBC News readers in Hong Kong and mainland China have been explaining why the issue has caused so much anger on the streets.
David Boyton, former police officer, Hong Kong
As a lawyer and a former Hong Kong police officer I did not initially care much for the Occupy Central movement.
I also felt greatly inconvenienced when I was stuck in Hong Kong traffic for several hours at one point because of these protests.
However, when I saw the unnecessary gassing of protesters who were not doing anything, my attitude completely changed.
This is an indication of what is to come - PRC [People's Republic of China]-style heavy-handed police tactics to deal with its own citizens.
It is no coincidence that the underlying movement promotes democracy and government accountability.
Why do the police, who are themselves citizens of Hong Kong, have to treat its own citizens with such disdain and contempt?
No doubt it will come out in the wash that, ""we were just following orders"". The unnecessary escalation by the Hong Kong police has changed my attitude completely.
The government and police must be made accountable; and this society must be allowed to move ahead in the way that the majority wishes.
I now fully support the protesters and I am ashamed of ever being a police officer in Hong Kong.
SK, a student at the Chinese University of Hong Kong
I spent a tense night amongst the students when it all started kicking off on Friday night.
The police just burst into a crowd that was formed by thousands of students and citizens who were outside the Hong Kong government headquarters.
Police used huge pepper sprays to attack the protesters. Students were shouting ""protect the students, police please leave!"" I support the student protests because Beijing's solution is unacceptable.
Hong Kong's leader, CY Leung, has ignored our demands to meet and that's why people in Hong Kong are so angry - not just us students.
Clara Me, Hong Kong
It's not that I don't sympathise with the protesters but I feel their way of going about things is too extreme.
I understand why they are doing it - but it is very naive to think if the students protest or speak loudly enough it will change things.
The Hong Kong government is under China's jurisdiction and if China doesn't agree, the Hong Kong government can't act. It's a difficult situation.
No-one wants another Tiananmen Square. People have been spreading rumours on social media of guns and tanks outside of Hong Kong and the territories - they are old pictures, it's not what is happening now.
So it makes me think some people want things to escalate. I want the protesters to calm down and go home.
Jason Liu, a civil engineer from Hong Kong
The students have been calm and peaceful.  Some brought food and water with them, and the protest has been well organised.
The students have been lying peacefully on the ground. The police seized a protester's loudspeaker and this is what caused the first disturbance.
The protesters were not happy about it and they tried to stop the vehicle that was taking it away.
The police are trying to persuade protesters to go away. The police increased the number of barricades to stop people going into the government square.
I believe they will escalate their actions in order to clean up the square. But the protesters have been sitting peacefully.
I've never seen this happen in Hong Kong in my life.
I want the world to know that we are peaceful; no looting or vandalism, but police still treat us as if we are rioting.
We only use umbrellas to protect ourselves from the tear gas.
Ben Sun, sales manager, Shenzhen, China
I don't support the protesters, especially those who are secondary school students. They are the ones in society who need to be protected from politics, not involved in it.
1 October is National Day. Whatever China looks like and feels like in everyone's heart, it is Mother's Day too.
No-one hates their mother even if she is ugly, poor or unwise. To protest on Mother's Day is no different to a rebellious child misbehaving.
People in Hong Kong are full of idealism. Do the university students even know what they are protesting about? I think they are too young.
Just like an older brother to a younger brother, I would suggest, please talk to your parents and respect their decision.
When you can raise children yourself and support your parents, then you will really understand.
Jessica Yeung, professor, Hong Kong
I agree with the protesters.
Civic Square is supposed to be a public space but a fence three metres high was erected around it only a few months ago. I think the government was preparing for protests.
I saw thousands of people gathering there. It was very moving. People were coming with food, drink, facemasks, raincoats and cling film - so as to protect against the pepper spray.
Beijing is being increasingly manipulative and controlling when it comes to Hong Kong's legislation.
There is a huge cultural difference and I don't think Hong Kong's legislation reflects the view of the residents to Beijing. This has caused a lot of misunderstanding.
The present government is responsible to a large extent for what is happening. They've blocked communications between democrats and Beijing.
Andy Bugden, Shenzhen, China
I don't know what the protesters expect to achieve.  I think Hong Kong people look down on mainlanders.
In about 30 years Hong Kong will return obediently to the mainland under one system.
They need to deal with reality. If they work with China then all will be fine - work against and they will find that China is stronger.
Hong Kong people are not going to get a choice that they want. A stable government is good for business.
The people of Hong Kong have to see the long-term view. They won't have democracy until China has democracy.",Tens of thousands of protestors have filled the streets of central Hong Kong demanding that China withdraws rules that allow it to vet candidates for the next leadership election.,29388345

He pleaded guilty at Hove Crown Court to burglary and two counts of attempting to cause GBH with intent and affray.
Piruz was previously jailed in the Netherlands for killing a woman.
PC Chick told the court: ""I have never been so scared in my life.""
PC Young, who was hit in the neck in the Crawley attack, described it as ""akin to a horror film"".
The court heard that after arriving in Britain in December 2015 to visit relatives, Afghan-born Dutch citizen Piruz missed his return flight home from Gatwick Airport on 4 January, 2016.
He went on to be arrested and prosecuted for assault after he spat at a member of EasyJet staff who told him he would need to buy a new ticket.
After appearing in court and being ordered to pay compensation, he went on to burgle garages in Crawley, where he stole tools including a hammer.
On 7 January police were called after a member of the public saw Piruz attempting a further break-in, which led to the attack on the officers.
Francesca Lewington, prosecuting, said Piruz was granted asylum in the Netherlands at the age of 16.
She said he was jailed for 12 years, of which he served six, for killing his female tenant in 2006. He locked her in a room before slitting her throat.

But less than 24 hours after the truce began, Aleppo residents were suggesting that life was slowly returning to normal - or at least as normal as could be expected under the circumstances.
Social media backed up reports that the cessation of hostilities was broadly holding.
Many users initially provided frequent updates on whether government and rebel forces were abiding by the agreement announced on Saturday by Russia and US, who back opposing sides.
As the truce entered its second day, they had switched to sharing photos of celebrations for the Islamic festival of Eid al-Adha, which also happened to start on Monday.
There was a sense of relief and cautious optimism after several very difficult months.
Some photos showed people shopping at markets in rebel-held areas in the northern provinces of Aleppo or Idlib - an activity that was fraught with danger only a few days ago.
Children were pictured laughing and playing in devastated streets and attending parties at which they could enjoy colouring and playing with balloons.
Several boys were even seen playing on an unexploded bomb in one Aleppo district.

Alastair Cook and Joe Root made 76 and Moeen Ali was last out for 61.
Hashim Amla was dropped on nought as South Africa reached 42-1- a lead of 175 - before bad light ended play.
James Anderson gave England faint hope of an attainable fourth-innings chase when Dean Elgar was caught behind in the third over, and England's record wicket-taker then saw Amla put down by a diving Alex Hales at third slip.
But Rabada's heroics will make the home side - 2-0 down in the series - confident of a consolation victory.
England resumed on 138-2 and lost four wickets for 73 runs in the 26 overs bowled before lunch. Cook and Root had calmly negotiated the first 13 of them but Morne Morkel began an impressive spell that yielded a collapse.
The big fast bowler produced a near unplayable delivery to Cook, with pace and steepling bounce that found the edge and was smartly taken by wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock.
Then Rabada utilised the overcast conditions to devastating effect, bowling a consistently dangerous line around the off stump and extracting sufficient pace and movement to find the edges.
Root, who successfully overturned a caught-behind decision off spinner Dane Piedt, had hit Rabada for three fours in an over but edged one that that nipped away off the seam.
""He is a real prospect, he's got something,"" former England opening batsman Geoffrey Boycott told BBC Test Match Special.
""You would think he would learn a lot from bowling with Dale Steyn when he comes back into the side. The world is his oyster.""
James Taylor, who struck his first ball delightfully down the ground for four, appeared intent on hooking anything short and a swipe at Rabada resulted in an edge to the wicketkeeper.
That forced Jonny Bairstow to begin his innings on the stroke of lunch and he fell third ball as another rising delivery from Rabada brushed his glove, which ended the morning session with England losing three wickets for three runs in 18 balls.
Cape Town hero Ben Stokes launched Piedt for four and a towering six in an over but he was caught at slip for 33 off Rabada in the first over with the new ball.
Moeen, who was dropped on 45, brought up a first Test fifty in 15 innings before he was last out, caught at deep point.
With the pitch showing signs of uneven bounce, England's chances of victory - with two days remaining - appear slim.
Boycott said: ""I don't think England can win from here. They haven't got a cat in hell's chance. All they can do is try to save the game.""

834,"The typical household had £26,332 to spend after taxes were paid and benefits received, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.
Retired households saw a faster rise than others compared with the previous year, owing primarily to income from private pensions.
The richest fifth of the population saw a slight fall in their spending power.
The average UK household saw their disposable income rise by £564 compared with the previous year, after the rising cost of living - measured by inflation - was taken into account, the ONS said.
Senior statistician Claudia Wells said: ""Household incomes are above their pre-downturn peak overall, but not everyone is better off.
""While retired households' incomes have soared in recent years, non-retired households still have less money, on average, than before the crash.""
The median average disposable income of pensioner households has recorded a rise of 13% since 2007-08, compared with a 1.2% fall among non-retired households.
The ONS puts growing private pensions ahead of the guaranteed rise in the state pension - under the so-called triple lock - as the long-term reason for the pick-up in pensioners' incomes.
However, the £21,770 of typical spending power for retired households remains below the £28,481 of non-retired households.
The top fifth of households saw real incomes fall back by £1,000 a year, while the poorest gained £700 on average in 2015-16, the ONS said.
Top pay levels have come under pressure, but employment prospects and pay for the poorest have improved, it added.
The figures come as Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he would like to see a maximum cap on the amount people can earn.
Household income has tended to pick up faster over the years owing to an increasing number of couples both in employment.
Matt Whittaker, chief economist at the Resolution Foundation think tank, said: ""It was another strong year for living standards, particular for poorer households. Strong employment growth, low inflation and rising pensioner incomes over recent years have helped drive inequality down to its lowest level in nearly 30 years.
""However, the last three years of growth have come back off the back of a living standards squeeze so deep that typical working age families are still £345 poorer than they were before the financial crisis.
""With employment plateauing, productivity growth refusing to budge and inflation rising, the risk is that this mini boom won't continue.""

Ms Jones, who has been the councillor for Askern Spa ward for the past seven years, will become the town's first female and second Labour mayor.
Incumbent mayor Mr Davies came second after receiving 24,725 votes.
He stood as an independent candidate after quitting the English Democrat party in February over claims of an influx of new members joining from the British National Party.
The turnout for the vote was 28%, with 62,132 voting out of an electorate of 223,608.  In 2009 the turnout was 39%.
Ms Jones said her win was a ""hugely proud and humbling moment"".
She said: ""Doncaster's spoken and it has said it wants a mayor who will always be on its side, who will stand up against any cuts that's Tory led, will go out and sell Doncaster to the world, to bring jobs and growth here, that's what we need.
""The people of Doncaster have put great responsibility on my shoulders. I accept it and say I will work my socks off for you.""
Mr Davies congratulated Ms Jones on her ""somewhat narrow victory"".
He said: ""I have enjoyed every minute of the experience, I have been privileged to service the people of Doncaster with what I think has been four years of common sense and taking nonsense out of council and political life.""
He added: ""I will not miss the council meetings, which are horrendous in the extreme more often than not.""

Ms Munirathinam was working as a domestic help. She is recovering in hospital.
Her family has alleged that she was being tortured by her Saudi employers.
Saudi authorities have not commented on the incident yet.
Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj wrote on Twitter: ""This is unacceptable. We have taken this up with Saudi authorities. Our embassy is in touch with the victim.""
""Chopping of [arm] of Indian lady - we are very much disturbed over the brutal manner in which Indian lady has been treated in Saudi Arabia,"" Ms Swaraj added.
The family of Ms Munirathinam in the southern Indian city of Chennai said that her employers had been ""angered"" after she complained about the ""harassment"" she was facing at her employer's home, where she had begun working three months ago.
They are asking the government to secure them compensation from the family, and also help pay Ms Munirathinam's medical expenses.
""Ever since she went to work with this family in July, things were not alright. My mother was not even allowed to speak to us over the phone, she was not given proper food and was forced to work long hours,"" her son S Kumar told BBC Hindi.
""When she tried to escape the harassment and torture, her right arm was chopped off by the woman employer. Now my sister can't even sit and do simple things on her own, as her spinal cord has also been injured,"" her sister S Vijayakumari added.
Ms Vijayakumari said her sister had been hospitalised in Riyadh and was ""in a serious condition"", adding that although they were relieved she was getting proper medical attention, they were unable to afford the expenses.
They have asked the Tamil Nadu state government to help them financially and have also sought the Indian government's help in securing Ms Munirathinam's return to India.
The family said that they had come to know of the incident through the ""agents"" who had hired her to work in Saudi Arabia. They also claim to have received a video message from Ms Munirathinam that has been recorded on a mobile phone.
Indian foreign ministry spokesperson Vikas Swarup told the Indian Express newspaper that India would ""continue to seek justice for the victim"".
""Our embassy in Riyadh has taken up the matter with the Saudi Foreign Office and asked for strict action in the matter and severe punishment for the sponsor,"" he said.
He said India had sought an independent probe in the incident and urged that ""a case of attempted murder be lodged against the sponsor so that he is punished, if found guilty as per law"".

838,"In which case, I have to admit a failure.
It's important to point out that I wasn't wholly to blame, what with the government taking me to court and all that.
Nonetheless what I've finally learned isn't a story now - and probably wouldn't have been when I thought it might have been.
Let me explain....
Four years ago, I asked what I thought was an entirely innocent question using Freedom of Information laws.
Back in 2010, the coalition government were trumpeting a new red tape-busting cabinet panel, the Reducing Regulation Committee. I suspected that it was all froth and no action, so in 2012 I asked how often they had met since the committee's creation.
Twenty working days later, I thought, I'd get a number closely resembling one, namely the original meeting. How wrong I was, on both fronts.
The Cabinet Office, bored rigid I can only assume, decided to refuse my request on the basis that disclosing the number would impinge on cabinet collective decision-making.  Balderdash I thought, or some other word beginning with B.
I therefore appealed, first to the Cabinet Office's own system (turned down) and then to the Information Commissioner's Office. Merry hell ensued. The ICO found in my favour, the Cabinet Office appealed, lost, appealed again, won, the ICO appealed for me, won, etc. Back and forth it went for three years. At one point, the government called in the fearsome-sounding ""Treasury Devil"", the so-called Star of the Bar, James Eadie QC, to argue their case.
Every few months a kindly solicitor at the ICO's office would email me with the latest twist in a story I had long lost interest in beyond knowing the indefatigable team at the ICO's office were sticking to their guns.
In November, word reached me that the end was nigh. A hapless Cabinet Office official was roundly condemned by a tribunal, who described her evidence as evasive and disingenuous.
Despite my increasing confidence that I'd get my answer, it was still something of a miracle to receive the response from the Cabinet Office on the Friday just before Christmas.
I'm now in a position to exclusively reveal to you, dear reader, that between 2010 and 2012, the Reducing Regulation Committee met on a total of 13 occasions.
You read it here first. Eventually.
Ministers are currently pondering whether to put restrictions on the Freedom of Information Act.  In the meantime, how much it cost in legal fees to refuse my request for three years will be the subject of my next FOI request.","Journalism is, at least in part, the art of delivering new information in a timely manner.",35221173

843,"Over the past 10 years, it has expanded its domestic influence but also become entangled in Syria's civil war. Here are ways it has changed in some key areas.
Hezbollah transformed from a party with limited power to a potent political heavyweight. It led a series of protests in late 2006 to demand greater decision-making power in cabinet.
In 2008, Hezbollah-led militants initiated clashes in Beirut after the government threatened to shut down its private telecommunications network, eventually acquiring veto power in cabinet.
The party dismissed the legitimacy of an international tribunal investigating the 2005 killing of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, which indicted five Hezbollah members.
It remained steadfast in the face of public dissent and a violent domestic backlash, manifested in sectarian clashes and bombings, over its involvement in the Syrian civil war.
For two years, Hezbollah has also used its veto power to prevent the election of a Lebanese president whom it does not favour.
Hezbollah underwent a significant shift, developing new capabilities and growing its ranks through its intervention in Syria, moving away from a purely Lebanon-Israel focus.
Its weapons arsenal grew from from 33,000 rockets and missiles before the 2006 war to an estimated 150,000. Similarly, it swelled from a few thousand members in 2006 to an estimated 20,000-plus.
After 2011, Hezbollah's military support for the Iran-backed Syrian government - its weapons supply line - gave its fighters considerable combat experience and exposure to Russian military planning. Hezbollah also trained pro-Iranian forces in Yemen and Iraq.
But it lost some of its highest-ranking officials in Syria, and found itself fighting Sunni extremist groups on Lebanese soil.
Hezbollah incurred financial losses from targeted sanctions and increased military expenditures. Several governments also linked Hezbollah to international drug trafficking rings and money laundering, claims the group has denied.
It receives substantial financial and arms support from Iran.
In 2016, Lebanese banks began to comply with a US law targeting Hezbollah's finances, closing down hundreds of Hezbollah-linked accounts.
Reports suggest it has struggled to pay compensation to families of fighters killed or injured in Syria.
Tensions between Hezbollah and Arab states soared. Hezbollah was condemned by most Arab governments for its ""adventurism"" in the July 2006 war. It still enjoyed considerable popular support across the Arab world, however, for fighting a ""common enemy"" - Israel.
A decade later, the Arab League, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) all branded Hezbollah a ""terrorist"" organisation.
In the eyes of predominantly Sunni Arab Gulf states, Hezbollah transformed into a Shia force killing Sunnis in Syria. Relations between Saudi Arabia - which also backs an anti-Hezbollah political bloc in Lebanon - and Hezbollah were particularly hard hit.
Hezbollah maintained its use of media as a political tool. In July 2006, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah asked viewers of its TV channel Al-Manar to watch as a burning Israeli warship sunk off the shores of Beirut.
The group has since developed an all-encompassing, offensive media strategy in its coverage of regional conflicts, alongside a surge in pro-Hezbollah social media pages.
Its discourse expanded from ""resistance"" against Israel to include sectarian messaging against Sunni extremism. Its media machine came under attack in 2015-16 when two leading Arab satellites took Al-Manar TV off air.
But Hezbollah also launched a largely successful venture in 2009 when it opened its war museum in south Lebanon, attracting locals and tourists alike.

844,"Some 400 Russian ratings are living in the western French port, awaiting delivery of their controversial new command-and-control ship, the Vladivostok.
By day the sailors receive instruction at an on-shore facility run by the Vladivostok's builders, STX France.
This week they have finally been allowed on board the vessel for the first time.
At the end of the afternoon they return to the Russian navy ship which serves as their sleeping-quarters.
The Russian navy flag - a blue Saint Andrew's cross on a white field, like an inverted Scottish saltire - flies from the stern.
There then follows half an hour of drill,  commanders barking out orders as files of sailors parade along the dock.  After that they mooch about and play football.
From behind a fence, locals come to stare.  The atmosphere is friendly enough - at one point an officer comes over to give a Russian navy badge to a child watching with his parents.
But otherwise there is no contact.  No-one here speaks Russian, and the Russians are under strict orders to stay tight-lipped.
A mass of gray steel, its superstructure looming over the town, the Vladivostok is moored a few hundred metres away.
Workers are applying some final touches, but essentially the Mistral-class helicopter carrier is complete and ready for delivery.
In another part of the dockyard not accessible to the public, work has started on a second ship, the Sevastopol.
As with the Vladivostok, the rear part of the Sevastopol - essentially the container part - was built in Russia.  It was then transported by barge to the French naval dockyards at Saint-Nazaire for the all-important front section to be attached.
The French government is now in a quandary over whether to go ahead with delivery of the ships.
On the one hand the warships could greatly enhance the power of President Vladimir Putin's navy.  And no-one in France wants that, during the current east-west crisis over Ukraine.
But on the other hand, the contract has been signed.  And in Saint-Nazaire hundreds of jobs are at stake.
It is beginning to look very unlikely that President Francois Hollande will stop the sale of the first ship, the Vladivostok.  It is paid for - and now the Russians have arrived to take delivery.
The fate of the second ship, the symbolically named Sevastopol, is less sure.  President Hollande will keep options open on that sale as long as he can.
Sevastopol has long been the Russian Black Sea Fleet's base in Crimea, a ""hero"" city associated with Soviet sacrifices in World War Two. But Mr Putin's annexation of the whole Crimean peninsula in March drew international condemnation.
Two problems complicate a  proposed alternative plan to sell the ships instead to Nato, or a friendly government.
First, as half of the ships was built in Russia, Russia actually owns part of them already.
Second, the ships are designed for Arctic ports with ice-breaking reinforcement.  There is no demand for that kind of ship outside of Russia.
Among the local people watching the Russian sailors, feelings are mixed.
""They're not going to use the ship to fight a war against France,"" says one woman. ""So what's the problem?""
But for Jean-Paul Regent, a retired ship-builder, ""It's a terribly difficult decision.  We need the jobs and the investment.  Building ships is what we do here.
""But for Putin's Russia?  The destination makes us feel very uneasy.  We are all in two minds about it all.""",The evening attraction in Saint-Nazaire this summer is watching Russian sailors practise their marching drill along the quayside.,28697529

It's often said that ""men are from Mars while women are from Venus"" but following the success of the Mars mission, many dubbed India's women scientists the ""women from Mars"".
""I am a woman from earth, an Indian woman who got an amazing opportunity,"" Ms Karidhal says.
""Mars mission was an achievement, but we need to do a lot more. The country needs a lot more from us so that the benefit reaches the last man.""
And who better than women scientists to do that?
Ms Harinath's first exposure to science was Star Trek on television.
""My mother is a maths teacher and my father is an engineer with a great liking for physics and as a family we were all so fond of Star Trek and science fiction and we would sit together and watch it on TV.""
Of course, at the time, she never thought of becoming a space scientist and for her, Isro ""just happened"".
""It was the first job I applied for and I got through. It's been 20 years now and there's been no looking back.""
Being part of the Mars mission was a high point of her life.
""It was very important for India, not just for Isro. It's put us on a different pedestal, foreign countries are looking at us for collaborations and the importance and attention we got was justified.
""It was also the first time Isro allowed the public to look at what was happening inside, we were on social media, we had our own Facebook page, and the world took notice.
""I feel proud of our achievement. Sometimes, I feel honoured and flattered, but sometimes I'm also embarrassed,"" she says, laughing. ""But now the way people look at you, it's very different. People recognise you for being a scientist. And I'm enjoying it thoroughly.""
Ms Harinath says she takes ""immense pride"" in Mangalyan and was ""really thrilled"" to see it's photograph on the new 2,000 rupee notes.
But it was not an easy assignment and the work days were long.
In the beginning, the scientists worked about 10 hours a day, but as the launch date came closer, it went up to 12 to 14 hours.
""During the launch, I don't think we went home at all. We'd come in the morning, spend the day and night, probably go home for a short time the next afternoon to eat and sleep for a few hours and come back. But for an important mission like that which is time bound, we needed to work like that.
""We spent many sleepless nights. We encountered lots of problems as we progressed, in the design as well as in the mission. But it was coming up with quick solutions, innovation that was brought in that was key.""
To make matters worse, her daughter's crucial school leaving exams fell right in the middle of the mission.
""Those few months were very demanding at work and at home. It looked like a race at the time. I'd wake up at 4am with my daughter to give her company while she studied. But now, we look back on that time with fondness. She did extremely well in her exams, scoring 100 in maths. Today, she's in medical school and is doing really well so I think it was all worth the effort.""
I ask if we can call her the ""woman from Mars"".
""I want to be grounded to earth. It's important to remain so, to bring out the best in a person,"" she says.
""The Mars mission was a huge achievement, but that's past now. We need to look into the future, to see what more we can do. We have the entire cosmic neighbourhood waiting to be explored. There are so many planets, so it's time to venture out.""
For this senior-most woman officer at Isro, the sky is the limit - she specialises in sending communication satellites into space that sit at least 36,000km from the earth's centre.
The scientist who has worked with Isro for the past 34 years first thought about space when she was nine.
""It was the Apollo launch, when Neil Armstrong landed on the moon. We had no television in those days, so I heard about it from my parents and teachers. It really ignited the imagination. I wrote a poem on a man landing on the moon in Kannada, my native language.""
Considered a role model by other women scientists at Isro, Ms Anuradha disagrees that women and science don't gel.
""I never liked subjects where I needed to remember a lot and science looked logical to me. I don't believe that Indian girls think science is not meant for them and I think maths is their favourite subject.""
When she joined Isro in 1982, there were only a few women and even fewer in its engineering department.
""In my batch, five-six women engineers joined Isro. We stood out and everyone knew us. Today, more than 20-25% of Isro's over 16,000 employees are women and we no longer feel special,"" she laughs.
At Isro, she says, gender is not an issue and the recruitment and promotional policies are all dependent on ""what we know and what we contribute"".
""Sometimes I say that I forget that I'm a woman here. You don't get any special treatment because you're a woman, you're also not discriminated against because you're a woman. You're treated as an equal here.""
She laughs at the suggestion that her colleagues consider her an inspiration, but agrees that having more women in workplace can be a motivating factor for other women.
""Once girls see that there are lots of women in the space programme, they also get motivated, they think if she can do it, so can they.""
Although the numbers of women staff has been consistently growing at Isro, it is still way below the halfway mark.
That's because ""we are still carrying cultural loads on our backs and many women think their priorities lie elsewhere, at home"", she says.
Her advice to women who want to be rocket scientists is simple: ""make arrangements"".
""Once I had made up my mind that I needed a purposeful career where my passion lay, I created a good set up at home. My husband and my parents-in-law were always cooperative, so I didn't have to worry much about my children.
""And I owe my success to the arrangements I made. You have to give something to get something. But life is like that. So when there was work to do, when I was needed at the office, I was here, working with passion. And when there was an absolute need for me to be at home, I was there.""

The forward, who has been capped twice by the Springboks, can operate as either a flanker or number eight.
Connacht scrum-half John Cooney is also joining Ulster and will replace crowd favourite Ruan Pienaar who is being forced to leave in the summer.
Cooney, 26, has penned a two-year deal and fulfils the IRFU directive that Ulster sign an Irish-qualified scrum-half to take over from South African Pienaar.
Botha has played 46 times for the Bulls, whose High Performance Manager admitted could not compete with the financial package tabled by the Irish province.
""Arno received a very good offer from Ulster,"" said Janse van Rensburg.
""The situation is that we can't financially make an offer close to what he's currently earning.""

An Independent Police Complaints Commission investigation is underway.
""I will work with the force and the IPCC over the coming weeks to understand fully the circumstances,"" said commissioner Dafydd Llywelyn.
The force referred the matter to the police watchdog following the incident at Maes y Bwlch in the Morfa area of Llanelli, Carmarthenshire.
Witnesses said Mr Beynon had stabbed himself and a dog with a kitchen knife before police used the stun gun on him.
Mr Beynon was a former member of The Royal Welsh regiment who toured Iraq and Afghanistan and served in the Army for 15 years.
He was later diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.
The IPCC said police officers were called by a member of the public who had become concerned about the welfare of the man who appeared to be injured.

854,"A report by a Universities UK taskforce has urged universities to take a ""zero-tolerance"" approach and provide better support to victims.
It was commissioned amid concerns about sexual harassment at UK universities.
While no comprehensive figures exist, one in seven female students polled in a 2010 student survey said they had been assaulted while at university.
The report also found that 68% of those surveyed recorded being subject to some form of verbal or physical sexual harassment on campus.
The National Union of Students (NUS) has been integral invoicing student concerns around sexual harassment and so-called lad culture across institutions.
Students at Queen's University in Belfast (QUB) has taken a proactive approach, working with the Police Service of Northern Ireland and rape crisis and counselling services to offer workshops, discussion groups and Q&As for this year's students.
Events also included a screening of The Hunting Ground, an Oscar-nominated documentary about the perceived failure of US college administrations to deal with the increasing incidence of sexual assault on college campuses.
QUB welfare officer Jessica Elder said she hoped her Consent is Bae initiative would become a regular campaign for the students' union, alongside mental health and other sexual health awareness.
Bae - short for 'before anyone else' - is a slang term meaning affection towards something and reflects Ms Elder's attempt to break existing taboos surrounding sexual harassment and assault on campus.
A qualified nurse, she ran for office with the idea central to her manifesto.
""It's something that people should be educated around and shouldn't feel awkward or uncomfortable talking about consent because it is an issue every day,"" she told BBC News NI.
""The clothesline project we are doing today allows people to talk about consent without verbalising it.
""People can express their feelings without feeling uncomfortable.""
Clothesline projects have been used worldwide to address issues of violence against women by providing a vehicle for silent expression of personal emotions and experiences.
A week-long series of events, ending on Friday, has aimed to create a safe space for students, giving them a platform to ""talk openly with like-minded people"".
The campaign has reached hundreds of students, with events proving very popular.
""Social media has blown up a bit, people are just really positive that the student's union is running a campaign like this,"" said Ms Elder.
""They feel it's really important.""
NUS-USI women's officer Collette McAllister said: ""There has to be a zero tolerance approach to sexual harassment, hate crime and violence amongst students and also wider society.
""It is also crucial that all survivors of sexual violence are provided with robust support, as outlined within this report.
""It is absolutely imperative that all education institutions in Northern Ireland take on board and implement the guidance and recommendations.
""All students must be able to study in a safe, inclusive and welcoming environment.""
A number of universities across the UK and Ireland have already introduced recommended and compulsory sessions as part of students' fresher's week inductions.
Ulster University has also announced it is to host a conference in November promoting safer relationships among students.

In August, a poll of 2,098 UK adults by the British Council poll found a quarter felt nervous at the thought of having to speak a language on holiday.
The Council's languages drive comes as the number of pupils taking GCSEs in modern languages continues to fall.
Higher Education Statistics Agency data released in February showed that entries to modern foreign language degree courses had dropped.
French fell by 25%, German by 34% and Spanish by 1%. Overall the number of entrants to modern foreign languages fell by 16% between 2007/08 and 2013/14.
The British Council says tackling ""just a phrase a day"" in a foreign language could see people greatly improve their language skills.
Supporting the Council's campaign, Mr Lamb said: ""Languages, for me, are about opening the world up. It gives you another soul, it gives you another person. My teacher, Miss Smith, started to teach us French.
""From learning French, I learnt German, from being in Germany I found out about amateur theatre and here I am today, talking to you about learning languages having had a career that's gone on for 40 years now.""

""And with lots of free and innovative ways to get started, there has never been a better time to take up a new language.

856,"The 19-year-old, from Burntwood in Staffordshire, launched an appeal in aid of the Teenage Cancer Trust but died this month.
His fundraising total hit the Â£4m mark earlier.
His mother Jane said the memorial service at Lichfield Cathedral was a ""celebration of his life"".
Stephen's body arrived on a horse-drawn carriage just before 19:00 BST.
A floral display spelling out 'STE' led the funeral procession from his home in Burntwood, Staffordshire, to Lichfield Cathedral.
The coffin was then moved inside the cathedral for a short service.
Speaking inside the cathedral, The Dean of Lichfield, the Very Reverend Adrian Dorber, said: ""Stephen's all too brief life has shown us the triumph of hope.
""In the last few weeks he's won the hearts and minds of people across the world and we are all the better for it.""
Stephen was diagnosed with terminal cancer at the age of 15. He drew up a ""bucket list"" of things he wanted to achieve before he died.
This led to him completing a skydive and playing drums in front of 90,000 people before the Uefa Champions League final at Wembley.
He originally wanted to raise Â£10,000 for the Teenage Cancer Trust but when his condition deteriorated, he set off in pursuit of Â£1m.
As his story spread, he earned a measure of global fame with donations from nearly 100 different countries.
Simon Fuller, director of services at the Teenage Cancer Trust, also spoke at the service and said it was a ""great honour"" and a ""privilege"" to know Stephen.
""I am deeply proud but not surprised by how the local community has pulled out all the stops to make this vigil happen,"" he said.
""Stephen's approach to cancer and his approach to life has inspired more people than we will ever know.""
Mr Fuller ended his speech by leading a round of applause in honour of the ""courage of Stephen"" and other young cancer sufferers around the world.
At the end of the service, mourners gave Stephen's trademark thumbs up gesture as they filed silently past his coffin.
A 38-minute compilation of Stephen's favourite tracks was then played.

All six are seeking damages for mistreatment, the Australian Broadcast Corp (ABC) reports.
The NT government had initially said it would bring a counter suit.
According to the ABC report, authorities say serious damage, costing A$89,000 ($67,000;£51,000), was caused when the boys escaped from the centre in 2015.
One day later, they allegedly stole a car and rammed it into a garage door at the centre, causing another A$74,000 worth of damage.
The boys' lawyer has argued his clients would not have tried to escape were it not for the ""poor and restrictive conditions"" in which they were held.
Footage of the tear gas incident and repeated mistreatment of a boy named Dylan Voller prompted Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to order a top-level government inquiry into youth detention in the state.
In one incident, Voller was cuffed to a restraint chair while wearing a hood and left alone for over an hour.
Youth detention rates are three times higher in the NT than elsewhere in Australia, according to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare.

""Brooklyn? Not a chance,"" said another driver. ""The bridge is closed by demonstrators.""
And so it was, in the city that doesn't sleep, the taxi drivers were going home early to bed.
Another week, another city, another dead black man, another grand jury and another white policeman not indicted. Oh, and another new chant.
Ten days ago in Ferguson, Missouri, it was ""hands up don't shoot"" after an unarmed black teenager was gunned down because according to some he had his arms up.
In New York it was ""I can't breathe, I can't breathe"" after the horrible video was released of Eric Garner speaking his final words, as this 350lb giant of a man was held in an apparent chokehold by an NYPD officer.
Now if the defence of Darren Wilson, the police officer in Ferguson, tested the credulity of the African American community - that he felt his life was in danger from Michael Brown - what possible justification can be offered for Daniel Pantaleo's deadly grip on Eric Garner in Staten Island?
The mobile footage somehow contrives to show the utter banality of this death. This was no high-speed car chase, shoot-out death. This was an amiable-looking black guy on a summer's day, standing, talking to a bunch of policemen in shorts - in shorts for goodness sake! - refusing to comply with their orders but hardly posing a threat either.
Anyway, no need to describe it further as I am sure that anyone reading this has already seen the video and its unhappy denouement.
But unlike in Ferguson where it seemed the federal government was not quite sure what to do initially - aside from appealing for calm - this time they were quick out of the blocks.
US Attorney General Eric Holder went on TV to announce that federal prosecutors would look at whether Mr Garner's civil rights had been infringed. In other words, Mr Pantaleo could still be prosecuted.
As a way of defusing tension, it was probably a very smart move. There was no repeat of the looting and rioting that came after the Michael Brown decision. Politically it was astute.
But will the federal government in Washington succeed in bringing an indictment where a Staten Island grand jury failed? That's the key question now
And the evidence is far from clear. I remember a senior British politician who in a previous life had been an eminent lawyer telling me you don't win a case just because something looks really, really bad.
While anyone looking at the video of the chokehold has probably a very clear view of how bad it was, that doesn't mean it's an open and shut case legally.
There will be minute examination of the judgements made during the arrest. Did Mr Garner offer any resistance; how much pressure was applied in the neck hold? Was it unreasonable force? Was the inability to breathe because of Mr Garner's asthma rather than the force of the hold? Did Officer Pantaleo try to resuscitate him?
Will prosecutors be able to demonstrate wilfulness on the part of the officer, the high standard of intent required by the Supreme Court.
Of course it is being stressed by the justice department that the federal investigation would be fair, thorough and expeditious. But the will of the politicians is clear - they want a prosecution.
Otherwise the conclusion will be that a man can be choked to death on a street in New York in plain view, with video evidence - with no consequence.
And few would think that would be the criminal justice system's finest hour.","Outside my Wall Street hotel last night, the taxi drivers were somewhat uncharacteristically turning business down.",30354140
861,"Milk teeth have been discovered in the fossil jaw of a juvenile Wareolestes rex, a species of mammal from the Middle Jurassic.
Scientists suggest adult females secreted milk on to a bare patch of skin for their young to lap up.
Nipples and suckling as seen in modern mammals had still to evolve when Wareolestes rex lived.
The two centimetre-long jaw was found on Skye in 2015 and is one of the most complete fossils of the early mammal to be found outside of China.
Single teeth of Wareolestes rex have previously been found in England.
Palaeontologists from National Museums Scotland in Edinburgh and the University of Oxford have been examining the fossil from Skye.
Using micro-CT scanning technology, they have identified milk teeth and, inside the jaw, adult teeth that had not erupted through the gums.
The scientists said this showed that Wareolestes rex replaced its teeth once, like humans and other modern mammals.
It had a set of milk teeth, followed by a set of adult teeth.
This pattern of tooth replacement was an important step in the evolution of mammals and is linked to the production of milk to feed young, the scientists said.
Elsa Panciroli, the PhD student who led the research of the fossil, said: ""This is such an exciting discovery.
""It's one of the most complete Middle Jurassic mammal fossils described from Scotland.
""This was a juvenile animal that was losing its milk teeth and the permanent teeth were just breaking through the gums.
""Tooth replacement like this tells us this early mammal fed on milk provided by the parent until it grew to adult size.""
She added: ""Wareolestes would have cared for its young, which is a behaviour we associate with modern mammals.""
Living in a period when dinosaurs were the dominant animal, Wareolestes rex were a large mammal for the time, with adults growing to the size of a guinea pig.
The method of Wareolestes rex delivery of milk to its young is similar to that of platypus.

""The real message will be the following week when midwives start counting the hours they currently work and which they are not paid for and they submit a bill to their employer asking to be paid for the breaks they do not get on a 12 hour shift and the hour or two hours they stay behind and work every day,"" she said.

866,"Mr Tohti, an economics professor who has criticised China's ethnic policies, has been detained since January. He has been charged with separatism.
His lawyer Li Fangping met with him for the first time this week.
He said Mr Tohti was denied food for 10 days after an attack on a Kunming train station in March that killed 29 people.
The attack was blamed on Uighur separatists by the Chinese authorities.
Mr Tohti is a member of the predominantly Muslim Uighur ethnic group from China's far western Xinjiang region.
He has been critical of China's treatment of the Uighurs but there is no record of Mr Tohti ever having supported the cause of separatism, says the BBC's John Sudworth.
Mr Tohti maintains his innocence, said his lawyer.
""He believes that in his words and deeds, he has always sought to work for the country's national interests and the organic integration of the Han majority and Uighur minority's common benefits,"" said Mr Li.
He added that Mr Tohti went on a hunger strike in January for 10 days to protest against being served food that did not follow Islamic dietary laws.
Authorities force-fed him milk when his organs started bleeding, his lawyer was quoted by news agencies as saying.
China has blamed a number of violent attacks on civilian targets over the past year on Uighur separatists and launched a sweeping security crackdown.
Earlier this month it executed 13 people for what it said were terrorism-related offences.
It has recently carried out at least two mass-sentencing events in front of large crowds gathered in sports stadiums.","The detained Uighur academic Ilham Tohti was denied food for more than a week and his legs have been shackled, his lawyer says.",28052094
867,"In a career spanning 50 years, she wrote more than 60 novels, as well as serving as a Labour member of the House of Lords.
Her most famous creation was Inspector Wexford, who appeared in 24 books.
But she also wrote more than two dozen standalone novels, and a further 14 under the pen-name Barbara Vine - an amalgam of her middle name and her great grandmother's maiden name.
Ruth Barbara Grasemann was born in 1930, in South Woodford in Essex, the only child of Ebba Kruse, who had been born in Sweden and brought up in Denmark, and Arthur Grasemann, who was English.
Her childhood was reputedly unhappy, but she rarely spoke of it in interviews, just as she refused to talk about the mystery of her marriage and divorce. She wed Don Rendell, a journalist, in 1953; the couple divorced in 1975 but remarried two years later. They had one son.
Rendell herself started out as a journalist on a local Essex newspaper, but resigned after filing a story about an after-dinner speech in which she failed to report that the speaker dropped dead halfway through - she hadn't been there.
The first Wexford book, From Doon with Death, appeared in 1964.  It was also her first published novel: she was paid an advance of Â£75.
Wexford - played in the successful television adaptations by George Baker - shared many of his creator's convictions and prejudices, though he was a Liberal Democrat and Rendell always described herself as a socialist.  ""The way he thinks, and his principles and ideas and what he likes doing, that's me,"" she told one interviewer.
The books were conventional crime stories, but the settings were contemporary and convincing - and while the novels' structures may have been conventional her way of writing them sometimes was not.
""I have an idea and I have a perpetrator and I write the book along those lines,"" she said in a BBC interview, ""and when I get to the last chapter I change the perpetrator, so that if I can deceive myself I can deceive the reader.""
But as well as the Wexford books, she wrote more than two dozen standalone novels, often featuring misfits and deviant characters on the margins of society.
And in 1986, she began publishing darker psychological thrillers as Barbara Vine.  They were, she said, more searching, more serious and more analytical than her other books.  And she admitted more than once to being fascinated by other people's secrets.
Many of her books did not just present readers with a puzzle but linked murder and crime with social injustice or economic disadvantage.
In Rendell's world, the conservative instincts of middle England often helped to provoke antisocial and irrational behaviour rather than keeping it in check.
That reflected her own political views.  Appointed a CBE in 1996, she was elevated to the House of Lords as a Labour peer in 1997.  She spoke out against racism, sexism and class disadvantage, and among her achievements as a working peer was the introduction of a 2003 act which made it a crime to send girls abroad to be subjected to female genital mutilation.
Fifteen years ago, her fellow crime-writer Val McDermid described her as unique among British crime writers.  ""No-one can equal her range or her accomplishment; no-one has earned more respect from her fellow practitioners.
""The broad church that is current British crime writing owes much to a writer who has... consistently demonstrated that the genre can continually reinvent itself, moving in new directions, assuming new concerns and exploring new ways of telling stories.""
And Ruth Rendell herself said of her 40-year friendship with another queen of the genre, PD James: ""Both of us thought more about the characters than the crime.""",Ruth Rendell was a leading member of the generation of writers who took crime fiction and turned it into literature.,31731722
868,"Russia said the document infringed the council rule allowing countries 24 hours to consider the final wording.
The US dismissed this as a ""made-up alibi"", saying Russia wanted to preserve recent military gains by Syrian government troops in Aleppo.
The army are reported to have seized more parts of rebel-held east Aleppo.
If confirmed, that would mean the government had recaptured about 70% of the rebel-controlled area in just over a week.
More than 100,000 people may be under siege in districts still under rebel control, where food supplies are exhausted and there are no functioning hospitals.
On Monday, Russia and China - both veto-wielding council members - voted against the draft submitted jointly by Egypt, New Zealand and Spain.
Venezuela also voted ""No"", while Angola abstained.
The other 11 UN Security Council members backed the resolution.
The document called for the ceasefire to allow the unimpeded access of aid to Aleppo.
Russia's UN envoy Vitaly Churkin said the draft had not been given the traditional 24 hours for it to be analysed.
He added that the vote should have been postponed until a meeting of Russian and US experts on Tuesday or Wednesday in Geneva.
US deputy envoy to the UN, Michele Sison, accused Russia of using a ""made-up alibi"".
""We will not let Russia string along the Security Council,"" she added.
French envoy Francois Delattre accused Moscow of having ""decided to take Aleppo regardless of the human cost"" of a military victory,
The UK's representative Matthew Rycroft said that in vetoing the resolution Russia and its supporters ""have also held to ransom the lives of hundreds of thousands of innocent men, women and children currently enduring hell in Aleppo"".
This is the sixth time in five years that Russia has used its veto power to block a draft resolution on Syria.

869,"The Manxman was led out perfectly by team-mate Gert Steegmans and surged clear of Norway's Edvald Boasson Hagen and Slovakian Peter Sagan.
It was Cavendish's first stage win of this year's Tour and his 24th in total.
A large pile-up in the final kilometre split the peloton but Simon Gerrans retained the leader's yellow jersey.
American rider Teejay van Garderen and Belgium's Jurgen van den Broeck, who was fourth in last year's race, were among those to go down in the crash.
34 - Eddy Merckx (Bel) 1969 to 1975
28 - Bernard Hinaut (Fra) 1978 to 1986
25 - Andre Leducq (Fra) 1927 to 1935
24 - Mark Cavendish (GB) 2008 to present
Britain's Chris Froome stayed out of trouble and remains seventh overall, three seconds back, after finishing with the same time as Spain's Alberto Contador and Australia's Cadel Evans, who are seen as his major rivals for the general classification.
But the day belonged to Cavendish, who had endured a frustrating time in the opening days of the Tour as well as suffering from illness.
The 28-year-old was denied a chance of victory - and taking the yellow jersey - after being held up in a crash at the end of stage one, and missed out on the podium on Tuesday when his Omega Pharma-QuickStep team were denied victory by 0.75 seconds in the team time trial.
This time, however, there was no stopping Cavendish - despite rumours circulating during the stage that he was still on antibiotics and would not be contesting the final sprint.
An early breakaway of six riders escaped after 3km of the 228.5km stage from Cagnes-Sur-Mer to Marseille but the last survivor, Kazakhstan's Alexey Lutsenko was caught with 3km to go.
""This stage was always going to come down to a sprint finish. It appeared there was a chance that the breakaway riders could stay clear but their lead came down very quickly before the end.
""That left us with a sprint and Mark Cavendish won very convincingly in the end. We were unsure how he would do because he has been under the weather but his team worked well for him and he made it look pretty easy.
""Now we know he is in good shape and he will be going for another win on Thursday. He might even get a chance on Friday, depending on how he is feeling before the race enters the Pyrenees.
""For me, Mark Cavendish has to not think about winning the points category. His main objective is to win stages and if he does that, the green jersey will take care of itself.
""He has got a very difficult job to beat Peter Sagan anyway because Sagan will pick up points where Cavendish will not figure.""
Listen to 5 live's stage five podcast
That set up the first bunch finish featuring the fastest men on this Tour, and it did not disappoint.
Cavendish stuck to Steegman's wheel before making his move with 250m to go and, although Boasson Hagen held off Andre Greipel to follow in his slipstream, neither he or the fast-finishing Sagan came close to denying him.
The Isle of Man rider raised his arms in triumph as he crossed the line, and is now only 10 wins short of Eddy Merckx's record of 34 Tour de France stage wins.
""I'm super happy,"" said Cavendish afterwards. ""Now the pressure is kind of off and hopefully it has started the ball rolling.
""It would have been nice to win on Tuesday but it's not to be underestimated how hard it is to get one stage win on this race.
""I didn't feel great but when the guys are committed like they were - not just in the final, but all the way today - it's important to pay them back.
""They show their motivation by riding themselves into the ground and, like I always say, that really does give you something extra. If I'd lost that sprint, I really wasn't paying the lads back.""
His Omega Pharma-QuickStep team manager Patrick Lefevere added: ""We had targeted this stage.
""A lot of good sprinters [have] won in Marseille and Mark, who loves the history of cycling, wanted to have his name associated with Marseille.""
Cavendish's win sees him move up to second in the points category with 76 points, 35 behind Sagan in the battle for the green jersey.
""I lost a couple of points to Cavendish but that's okay, the important thing is to not lose too many,"" Sagan said. ""Mark is the fastest man in the world, it's almost impossible to beat him.""
Thursday's sixth stage, a flat 176.5-km ride from Aix-en-Provence to Montpellier, gives Cavendish a chance for another victory.
He needs one more stage win to move level with Andre Leducq in third place on the Tour's all-time list of stage winners. Other than Merckx, only Bernard Hinaut, with 28, has more.

""He's got a bit of a headache but he's up and about now and having a chat.

The hosts had already slipped to 22-3 in the deciding game when Morgan was replaced by Jonny Bairstow. They went on to lose by eight wickets.
The blow to Morgan, who was wearing a helmet, caused immediate concern for the visiting players, less than a year after the death of Phillip Hughes, the Australia batsman who passed away after being struck on the neck by a bouncer.

Planning permission is still required for the project, but the company hopes the hatchery will be up and running in 2019.
The move is expected to create up to 25 permanent skilled jobs.
SSF said the investment was part of plans to invest a total of £70m in improving and maintaining its existing sites and acquiring new ones over the next few years.
The new land-based freshwater facility at Barcaldine will be used to rear young salmon, or smolts, in ""bio-secure and environmentally friendly conditions"".
SSF, which is owned by SalMar and the Leroy Seafood Group of Norway, said it would embark on a consultation with the local community over its plans.
The company said the new facility would raise its annual production of smolts from five million to 11 million.
SSF managing director Jim Gallagher said: ""We have ambitious plans for sustainably growing the volumes of salmon we produce to meet increased demand across the world for premium Scottish salmon.
""As part of this, we have been evaluating locations around Scotland to build and develop our freshwater business, and I am delighted that we have found a site that offers an ideal location providing everything we want in terms of power supply, freshwater and connection to the sea.

875,"Dozens of activists died when Poland's last communist leader Gen Jaruzelski cracked down on dissidents.
Hours before the rallies, the leader of the ruling centre-right Law and Justice party, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, branded the current opposition as ""anti-state"".
He went on to threaten to ""bring order"" to opposition activity.
Mr Kaczynski, widely seen as the power behind Poland's government, did not specify what he had in mind during a radio interview. Addressing a pro-government rally later, he ridiculed opponents for resisting plans to change a system which he said had harmed the majority of Poles.
However, the Committee for the Defence of Democracy (KOD) commemorated the anniversary of martial law with anti-government marches across the country, and a large crowd snaked through the centre of Warsaw.
Protesters highlighted government policies on women's rights as well as reforms to education and the top legislative court.
Many members of Poland's current governing Law and Justice (PiS) party were part of the opposition Solidarity movement, which the communist regime set out to crush under martial law.
Thirty-five years on, Poland's opposition leaders say PiS, and its head Jaroslaw Kaczynski, are behaving as badly as the communists, restricting democratic freedoms and hobbling the Constitutional Tribunal so it is unable to veto the government's programme.
Mr Kaczynski says the opposition refuses to accept PiS's victory in last year's elections and its continuing popularity, branding the accusations ""absurd"".
Simple comparisons to the communists are overblown, of course, but Mr Kaczynski continues to give more liberal-minded Poles cause for concern, branding them ""anti-state"" and warning that the government plans to introduce measures to bring ""order"" to the opposition's activities.
Gen Wojciech Jaruzelski argued that he had imposed martial law on 13 December 1981 to deter a Soviet invasion.
But in the subsequent crackdown, thousands of members of the pro-democracy Solidarity movement were arrested and as many as 100 people died. Martial law was lifted two years later and Gen Jaruzelski eventually stood down in 1990. He died in 2014.
Poland's defence minister said on Tuesday that the government would act to strip the late general and his late deputy, Gen Czeslaw Kiszczak, of their military ranks.","Poles have marked the 1981 imposition of martial law with marches, and thousands used the occasion to protest against the conservative government.",38304692

Yet, he continues: ""Something's happened with Brexit and with Trump, people can now hear these views on TV and believe it's a legitimate way to think about people.""
He says he feels it's now harder to be patriotic in the wake of the UKs vote to leave the EU.
""Some people will think you're racist. Patriotism is linked to nationalism and it's not the same thing,"" he says.
""I view myself as very patriotic but it's got nothing to do with the idea of wanting to be separate from Europe. We're an island, but a mix of cultures and languages has made us what we are. It's very sad to watch people think it's not the case.""
Imperium was made last year, the actor explains, ""when I couldn't have anticipated any of these views expressed in the film being mainstream. Trump was a joke candidate"".
The film, co-starring Australian actress Toni Collette, is a collaboration between its writer-director, American Daniel Ragussis, and former FBI agent Mike German, who provides the inspiration for Radcliffe's role as Nate Foster. German was an undercover infiltrator in Far Right movements for years, leading to many arrests.
However, despite some high-profile attacks, most notoriously the Oklahoma bombings in 1995, carried out by white supremacist Timothy McVeigh, Ragussis believes the focus on so-called Isis-inspired terrorism means coverage of Far Right violence is no longer prominent.
""White supremacist groups are not necessarily classified as terrorists,"" he explains.
""I feel like we don't have to draw attention to people inspired by Isis,"" adds Radcliffe. ""When the bomb went off in New York, I was saying to myself 'please don't let the perpetrator be black, or Muslim - because then it will be used by Trump'. But we do need to draw attention to the Far Right's activities.""
The actor says his Jewish heritage ""wasn't a deciding factor in making this film"".
""It's also to do with my Dad coming from Northern Ireland. The film makes the point that terrorism comes in a lot of forms.
""I know from my Dad being Irish, that white people do this too. I think it's useful to remind people of that right now.""
Radcliffe adds that he ""dipped into"" Adolf Hitler's 1925 autobiography, Mein Kampf, and expresses the hope that neo-Nazis would watch Imperium.
""I don't care if they do it as some kind of hate activity because I am Jewish, I feel that this is the kind of film they might watch because, while we don't have an open mind about their ideas, we do have an open mind about white supremacists as people - if you watch the film, not everyone in there is a skinhead, they are not portrayed as monsters.""
However, it was Radcliffe's shaved head, done during a scene in the film, that gave Imperium most publicity as the first pictures caused an internet sensation when they were first released last year.
""It shouldn't be news that someone got a haircut but I guess that's ultimately good for the film,"" says Radcliffe.
He says he also accepts, although doesn't understand, why five years since the last Harry Potter film, such fan frenzies occur.
""I have sat next to actors in interviews and listen to them give answers to media questions and think, 'I could never say that, that will go everywhere'. It's super weird - I've got better at dealing with it though.
""I'll just keep on making different choices to do different films - and the fact that they are all so different these days isn't a comment on my role as Potter, I just don't want to repeat myself.
""So no one should ever expect a re-run of Woman in Black, Kill Your Darlings, or Imperium at all.""

In his first public appearance since April, he appeared frail and remained seated during the event.
Fidel Castro, who stood down in 2008, had earlier attacked US President Barack Obama in a newspaper column.
He criticised Mr Obama for not apologising to the people of Hiroshima for the nuclear bomb dropped there by the US in World War Two. Mr Obama visited the Japanese city in May.
""He lacked the words to ask for forgiveness for the killings of hundreds of thousands of people,"" Mr Castro wrote.

884,"The child, now two, had been placed with foster carers after her parents were unable to care for her.
A High Court judge then ruled the youngster should be cared for by the grandparents - her father's parents.
But the foster couple hoped to adopt her and brought a challenge. The Family Division of the High Court in Newcastle has ruled in their favour.
The four-day hearing was described by Mr Justice Cobb as being ""as difficult as any"" to come before the family court.
He said the grandmother was 58 and the grandfather was 60 while the couple who wanted to adopt, who he called Mr and Mrs X, were in their 30s.
The grandparents had seen little of their son for the past decade and had never met his partner, both of whom had learning difficulties.
When the child was born she was placed with foster carers, and when council social services staff had not traced any relatives a judge ruled she should be placed for adoption.
Mr and Mrs X, who had been looking after her since December 2014, then made an application to do so.
However, in June 2015 the girl's biological parents, who had moved to another area, had a son.
Social services staff from the second council searched for relatives and traced the grandparents.
It was only then that the older couple learned about the existence of their granddaughter.
A High Court judge ruled she should be cared for by them, but Mr and Mrs X challenged this in the Court of Appeal, which ordered a review.
In the latest hearing, Mr Justice Cobb said experts agreed the child would suffer ""trauma, distress, confusion and emotional harm"" if ""uprooted"" from the home of Mr and Mrs X.
While this had to be weighed against the possibility of her suffering long-term harm and ""feelings of rejection""  if she stayed with her adopted family, he had reached the ""clear conclusion"" that this would be in the child's best interests.
He said: ""Inevitably, as much as this outcome will provide great joy to the Xs, it will generate profound disappointment to the paternal grandparents.""
Neither councils could be named, and Mr Justice Cobb added:  ""I should record that the paternal grandparents express anger at the [first] local authority for failing to take the relevant steps to trace them when proceedings were afoot in relation to [the girl] in 2014.

Go-getters in the ghetto
Cinthia has lived all her life in Goussainville, on the north-eastern fringes of the Paris area. Her parents settled there from the French West Indies in the 1960s.
Cinthia and her family rent a flat in the housing estate where she grew up. The place, she says, has changed a lot since then, and ""not always for the better"".
There has been an influx of migrant workers over the past 20 years, in part because of good transport links - Goussainville is on the regional rail network and central Paris is just 25 minutes away by train.
The town now has sizable communities not just from sub-Saharan countries and North Africa, but also from the Middle East, Turkey, Pakistan and Bangladesh.
As foreigners moved in in higher numbers, locals moved out. ""There are fewer and fewer people of French origin in Goussainville,"" Cinthia says.
She is not interested in relocating to the remote periphery of Paris, as many French people have done. Goussainville  is a short drive away from Charles de Gaulle airport where she works for a company making airline meals.
Still, she would like to leave her estate. ""People here do not respect the place,"" she says.  As an example, she mentions a recycling scheme that did not last: people just left their rubbish on the pavement.
A few years ago Cinthia and her family tried to move to a nearby residential area, but could not as her husband was unemployed.  Now both have jobs but properties in Goussainville have become too expensive. At 46, she can no longer afford a mortgage.
""I have four children and must choose my priorities. I would have liked a house with a garden,"" she says. ""Sometimes you have to give up on your dreams.""
The best Cinthia's family could do was get a new apartment in a slightly quieter corner of the estate.
Svetlana, Cinthia's 20-year-old daughter, has a better chance of doing moving out.
Walking through the estate, she points to a spot near her old flat where kids used to set rubbish bins alight.  ""We see a lot of burnt cars over there,"" she says. ""There have been fights as well.""
Svetlana's future is uncertain - she talks about becoming either a philosophy teacher or an interior designer - but she is sure she wants to leave Goussainville behind.
What worries her is that youths on the estate ""do not have any goal in life"".
""I feel a bit lost myself.  I'm not sure what I'm going to do with my life,"" she says. ""When I see kids being so aimless, hanging around all day on their quad bikes, I think: I don't want my children to be like that.""
The daughter of migrants from Mauritius, Sharron grew up in Aubervilliers, a northern suburb of Paris with a rotten reputation. As a teenager, she struggled to get part-time jobs because of where she lived.
But she did not give up. Sharron went off to study at London Metropolitan University, returned to Paris to cut her teeth as a businesswoman and get an MBA while raising a family.
With years of experience in the tech sector under her belt, she is launching a digital strategy consultancy.
Coming from Aubervilliers, she says, has toughened her for life as an entrepreneur. ""Every time someone tells me I can't do this, I tell myself I will prove them wrong.""
""I always say to young people: if you don't say what's on your mind, no one is going to know. You have to move, you have to do something. I had a lot of support from my family and my friends but I always knew it was down to me.""
Sharron's hometown was once a burden, but now she regards it as a badge of honour.
""When people say to me you come from Aubervilliers, I say, yes I do but then I went to London and then I came back,"" she says. ""I'm proud and I always make sure people know I come from Aubervilliers.""
Imene lives with her Tunisian mother and her brothers on a council estate in Vallauris, near Nice.
Until she was 15, she attended a local school where most pupils were of North-African origin, like her.
The teachers' expectations, she says, were minimal and so was the teaching.  In literature, instead of the classics, they were given modern stories about immigrant families to read.
A teacher once told her she would end up working as a housemaid. ""That kind of insult left us traumatised,"" says Imene. Most of her friends dropped out at the age of 16.
Thankfully, another teacher saw her potential and fought to get her a place in a lycee, where she could prepare for the baccalaureat.
Imene discovered with wonder that there was more to French literature than tales of growing up on high-rise estates.
She worked hard to catch up in her studies and passed her ""bac"". She is now studying to become a social worker while volunteering for a women's charity in Vallauris.
Ideally, Imene would like to get a master's, but she is settling for a lesser degree as she needs to start earning enough money to help her family move out of their estate.
""We'd like to live in a quieter area, with less fear,"" she says. ""I worry about my younger brothers.  It's tough here. And there is still discrimination in education. I'd like to take them to another school where they'll be properly looked after.""
Sandra is the granddaughter of North African migrants. Her father is a taxi driver and mother a municipal employee. Both were born in France.
Sandra grew up in the Goussainville estate where Cinthia Piquionne and her family still live. But unlike them, her parents were able to move to a nearby residential area when she was 14.
However she stayed in the same school, and has no serious complaint with the education she received.
She was once humiliated by a form tutor who ridiculed her aspiration to study law. ""Look at her!"" The teacher said in front of the whole class, ""She has ideas above her station.""
But other teachers, Sandra says, encouraged pupils to go for good careers. ""They told us that if we tried, we would at least have the satisfaction of giving it a good shot.""
She got her degrees with flying colours, and now works a trainee lawyer for a multinational insurance company.
At no point did she feel discriminated against. Her North African background, she says, ""was just never a factor"".
She denies being exceptional. Many of her old school friends, she insists, are in business schools.

It also deleted Iron Dome by Gamytech, which challenged players to ""intercept the rockets launched by Hamas"".
Other titles that do not name the ""enemy"" remain online.
Advocacy groups have criticised the emergence of the genre.
""It is both deplorable and dangerous to glorify Israelis killing Arabs or Arabs killing Israelis,"" Morton Klein, president of the Zionist Organization of America, told the BBC.
Chris Doyle, director of the Council for Arab-British Understanding, added: ""Games that glorify violence or normalise conflict when referring to an actual conflict that is happening as we speak are deeply problematic and deeply distasteful.
""Google, Facebook or any other company that hosts such games, should be reviewing their policies and making absolutely all efforts to ensure that such games are not hosted on their platforms.""
Amnesty International UK has also declared that such titles are ""in highly questionable taste"".
The Daily Dot was one of the first news sites to bring attention to the phenomenon, on Monday, when it named several Android games relating to the conflict.
Google later blocked three titles as part of its initial response to user complaints:
A playable Bomb Gaza app was also subsequently removed from Facebook - the BBC understands that the social network decided to take it offline.
The site, however, still has a page promoting the game, which describes it as ""very addictive and fun"" to play.
Google Play and Apple's iOS store continue to host another title: Iron Dome - Missile Defense, by Shy Rosenzweig, co-founder of Meetey.com.
Released on July 21, it tasks the player with defending ""your city against endless enemy's missiles and rockets"".
Mr Rosenzweig told the BBC he deliberately avoided naming the enemy as being Hamas or fighters from Gaza.
""I wish not to see apps that support hate in any way,"" he said.
""I believe that many apps have been removed simply because people reported them, mostly because the app name or description related directly to the conflict.
""I anticipated this scenario and made sure to publish my game within the acceptable boundaries of Apple and Google.""
The Android store also offers other recently uploaded Iron Dome-themed titles in which the adversaries are described as ""terrorists"".
It also contains Gaza Hero - a game in which the player taps Israeli army characters to turn them into food and medicine, which states ""curse Israel"" on its introduction screen - as well as Gaza Defender, which involves firing at aircraft above.
A spokeswoman for Google would not discuss specific apps, but said: ""We remove apps from Google Play that violate our policies.""

887,"The remains of three skeletons were found inside Rosslyn Chapel when work to the heating system required floor slabs to be lifted.
Radiocarbon dating of two of the skeletons indicates they could have been buried in the mid-15th Century.
They were possibly buried at about the same time the chapel was constructed.
It is thought the skeletons were male and that at least one of them had undertaken heavy or repeated physical activity, with well-developed bone surfaces at the sites of muscle insertions.
Bones that had previously been disturbed were also found in the chapel precinct, with these dated back to between the 15th and 17th centuries. These were thought to be the remains of an adult male.
The AOC Archaeology Group in Midlothian carried out the excavation and analysis of the bones for the Rosslyn Chapel Trust, with the bones then prepared for reburial in line with guidance from Historic Environment Scotland.
Lindsay Dunbar, fieldwork project manager at AOC Archaeology Group, said: ""Opportunities to work at such a world-famous and iconic monument as Rosslyn Chapel come along rarely, so it was with great anticipation that AOC undertook the archaeological monitoring during the construction of the new visitor centre and works at the chapel.
""The discovery of both disturbed and in situ burials was especially exciting given the limited amount of excavation necessary within the chapel to complete the conservation works.
""AOC was allowed ample time to complete the full excavation of the burials and the good preservation of the human bone allowed full osteoarchaeological analysis to be completed.
""Whilst it is unlikely that the burials represent the clergy, it is clear that to occupy such a space within such a small chapel means that these burials are of people important to the chapel.""
Ian Gardner, director of the Rosslyn Chapel Trust, said: ""The analysis provides valuable information about the age of the remains but, inevitably, questions remain unanswered about the identity of these men and their roles here.
""Today's ceremony to reinter the remains was simple but a very fitting way to return them to Rosslyn Chapel.""

Mr Mitchell, who may face costs of Â£2m, said he was ""bitterly disappointed"".
PC Rowland said he and his family had been through ""indescribable pain"".
""I am delighted to hear again my innocence, my reputation and my integrity as a police officer has been recognised. I hope now that a line can be drawn and everyone can be left in peace,"" he added.

Mr Mitchell acknowledged that he had used bad language but maintained he had not used that word.
Giving his ruling, Mr Justice Mitting said: ""For the reasons given I am satisfied at least on the balance of probabilities that Mr Mitchell did speak the words alleged or something so close to them as to amount to the same including the politically toxic word 'pleb'.""
He ordered Mr Mitchell to pay interim costs of Â£300,000 but the total bill he will face is not yet known.
Responding to the verdict, Mr Mitchell said: ""Obviously I am bitterly disappointed by the result of the judgment today.

His majority is massive, so he's comfy in his Sutton Coldfield seat.
But Andrew Mitchell may have no choice but to go and earn more than the Â£67,060 an MP gets if he is landed with a multi-million pound bill for costs and damages.
David Cameron held on to him in the immediate aftermath of the scandal in September 2012, showing his characteristic loyalty.
As a sign of how highly he was regarded there was talk, even after he'd quit the cabinet, that Mr Mitchell might return to frontline politics with a job in Brussels as the UK's commissioner.
That didn't happen, and hopes of any return are now completely gone.
Outside court Mr Mitchell described the past two years as ""miserable"".
That misery continues, and the former army officer turned investment banker has the next few months to decide - as do party chiefs - if he will continue as an MP.
The judge gave his verdict after listening to two weeks of evidence from 26 witnesses and considering volumes of documents concerning a 15-second exchange.
Weighing up the competing claims, the judge said PC Rowland was ""not the sort of man who would have had the wit, imagination or inclination to invent on the spur of the moment an account of what a senior politician had said to him in temper"".
He added that gaps and inconsistencies in PC Rowland's account did not demonstrate he had fabricated his account, as Mr Mitchell's lawyers claimed.
If he was making up his account, PC Rowland would have had to have come up with the words within seconds, according to the judge.
The altercation took place as Mr Mitchell, who was government chief whip at the time, attempted to leave Downing Street via the main gate on his bicycle.
Steve White, chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said he was ""pleased"" that ""Toby's name has been cleared and his integrity restored"".

892,"The Beijing Municipal High People's Court ruled in favour of Xintong Tiandi Technology, said the official Legal Daily newspaper.
Xintong Tiandi trademarked ""IPHONE"" for leather products in China in 2010.
Apple filed a trademark bid for the name for electronic goods in 2002, but it was not approved until 2013.
""Apple is disappointed the Beijing Higher People's Court chose to allow Xintong to use the iPhone mark for leather goods when we have prevailed in several other cases against Xintong,"" said a spokesman for the firm.
""We intend to request a retrial with the Supreme People's Court and will continue to vigorously protect our trademark rights.
""We work hard to make the best products in the world and want to ensure our customers' experience is not compromised by companies who try to profit from using our brand.""
The Legal Daily (in Chinese) is widely recognised as the official mouthpiece for the country's Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission. Its report came out in late April but has only just been widely circulated.
Xintong Tiandi sells handbags, mobile phone cases and other leather goods branded with the name ""IPHONE"", close to Apple's iPhone mark, and the ""R"" registered trademark symbol.
Apple first brought the case against the company to the Chinese trademark authority in 2012, then when that failed, filed a lawsuit in a lower Beijing court.
But both ruled against Apple, so it appealed to the higher court.
The higher court ruled that Apple could not prove it was a well-known brand in China before Xintong Tiandi filed its trademark application in 2007.
Apple iPhones first went on sale in China in 2009.
The ruling comes shortly after Apple's latest results which showed a 13% drop in revenue on slower iPhone sales. Sales in China had plunged by 26%.
Apple is also facing difficulties in other operations in China. In March, Beijing passed a law that required all content shown in China to be stored on servers based on the Chinese mainland.
As a result Apple's iBooks and iTunes services were shut down in the country. Apple said it hoped access to the services would be restored soon.

893,"But this year, they are quieter than usual. A travel advisory issued by Beijing has caused a sharp fall in arrivals from China.
""We are worried and we are affected,"" said Dionisio Salme, president of the Boracay Foundation Inc., the island's resorts' association.
Since the warning was issued on 12 September, Boracay has seen a steep drop in Chinese visitors. Numbers fell from 18,479 in August to less than 7,000 in September.
This trend continued into China's week-long public holiday in the first week of October, normally one of the peak travel seasons for Chinese tour groups.
According to Mr Salme, while bars and clubs on Boracay's main beach are still crowded with Filipinos and tourists from other countries, the large resorts which take in busloads of Chinese tourists are nearly empty.
Airlines have been hit too. Cebu Pacific (CEB), a major Philippine budget carrier, cancelled 149 chartered flights scheduled between September and December 2014, with a loss of an estimated 24,138 passengers.
AirAsia has also suspended flights from Beijing and Shanghai to Kalibo, the regional airport servicing Boracay. As the travel advisory hit its fourth week, it also reduced flights between Manila and Shanghai.
Jorenz Tanada, vice-president for corporate affairs for Cebu Pacific, remains cautiously optimistic. ""CEB continues to operate scheduled commercial flights to and from mainland China,"" he said, adding that the airline hoped the advisory would be ""lifted at the soonest possible time"".
In its advisory, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs cited a ""worsened security situation in the Philippines"" that may see Chinese nationals targeted.
It followed an alleged bomb plot against the Chinese embassy, the kidnapping of an 18-year-old man in the southern Philippines and general concern about criminal gangs.
The Philippine military has since dismissed the alleged bomb plot, noting that the man arrested was a fringe politician whose bombs were merely firecrackers, and the Chinese embassy has yet to determine if the kidnapped man was indeed a Chinese national.
Aileen Baviera, a professor who specialises in Philippine-China relations at the Asia Center of the University of the Philippines Diliman, said it seemed hard to justify the advisory.
""There are so many Chinese in the Philippines, they're all over the country. So these are really isolated incidents,"" she said.
But the advisory was issued amid high tensions between Beijing and Manila over territorial disputes in the South China Sea  and is widely seen in the Philippines as going beyond Beijing's security concerns for its tourists.
""Hyping up the danger to their own nationals in the Philippines is one way that they [Beijing] put subtle pressure on the government,"" Ms Baviera said.
China issued a similar travel advisory in 2012, at the height of a stand-off at the Scarborough Shoal - a reef claimed by both Beijing and Manila.
That time, it cited a protest planned outside the Chinese embassy in Manila. Of the 1,000 protesters expected by the Chinese embassy, only about 200 showed up, and anti-Chinese violence did not materialise.
The new fall in tourists has already had an economic impact. China is the fourth largest source of foreign tourists in the Philippines, after South Korea, the United States and Japan.
Chinese tourists spent 6.46bn pesos (Â£89.5m; $144.7m) in the country between January and August 2014, according to a report by the Philippine Department of Tourism.
But in the four days immediately following the advisory, Boracay alone announced 500m pesos in losses due to cancellations.
Some of the people most affected are ethnically Chinese Filipinos who operate the travel agencies used by Chinese tourists.
James Lim is a Mandarin-speaking Chinese-Filipino guide based in Cebu City, the jumping off point for many of the Philippines's most popular tourist destinations.
Mr Lim, who is accustomed to back-to-back tour groups arriving in Cebu directly from China, said the drop in arrivals has put him on an unplanned holiday. He was spending most of his days at a cafe, or playing ping pong.
He declined to read into what the travel advisory could mean for Philippine-Chinese relations, but insisted that Chinese nationals are not specifically targeted by criminals.
Like other private businesses feeling the strain of the travel ban, Mr Salme is looking for assurances and solutions.
He has asked the Philippine government and the Department of Tourism for help, and invited representatives to the island to discuss ways to bridge the gap in revenue until the advisory is lifted.
""We're just hoping and praying that this can be resolved in the shortest period of time,"" he said.
Government officials, meanwhile, appear reluctant to discuss the subject. The Department of Tourism declined to elaborate to the BBC, as have some large private firms who are concerned about straining their relationship with the Philippine government over the sensitive political nature of the advisory.
In a press briefing on 6 October, Charles Jose, the spokesman for the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs, said officials were ""trying to map out concrete steps that we could take to basically convince China that we are taking measures and that we are guaranteeing and ensuring the safety and protection of their nationals"".
On Boracay island, Mr Salme said local authorities were not aware of any incidents targeting any nationalities.
""For us, tourists are a big help and we want to really protect all nationalities,"" he said. ""It is beyond our control what's going on. It's up to our government to find some solution.""",The beaches and restaurants of Boracay Island are usually bustling with tourists from around the world.,29684938
894,"Reggie Fils-Aime, president of Nintendo America, told Polygon that Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild would be the company's final game for the device.
""We really are at the end of life for Wii U,"" he said.
The Wii U struggled to match the success of the original Wii device. It will be succeeded by the Nintendo Switch console in March.
Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - the latest instalment in one of the best-selling game franchises of all time - was first announced in 2013.
But the game has faced multiple delays and will now be released on the Wii U and Nintendo Switch simultaneously.
Nintendo has previously indicated that the production of Wii U hardware was due to end.
However, Mr Fils-Aime said that the company would continue to provide online services for Wii U players, and that third-party publishers may still decide to release software.

The original Wii with its quirky motion-controlled party games quickly became Nintendo's best-selling home console, so it's easy to see why the company wanted to ride that wave.
But critics say the Wii U name confused shoppers, making it sound like an accessory or enhanced version of the original console.
Others say Nintendo fudged the marketing, with confusing messages about what the new touchscreen controller could do.
In some games it worked as a ""second screen"" to display maps or inventory - but few third-party games properly supported it.
It could also be used to play without a TV, as long as you were at home, and near the console, and playing a game that supported it.
For many gamers, the Nintendo Switch is what the Wii U should have been: a device that operates consistently as a handheld and home console.
Now, as Nintendo presses its final discs for the short-lived Wii U, it must convince players that its next console is worth the investment.

895,"Abdulemam, known as the ""Bahraini Blogger"", had been sentenced to 15 years in prison on charges that he was part of a terrorist organisation.
He spent two years in hiding after a royal pardon was revoked.
Abdulemam escaped in a secret compartment of a car up a causeway that joins Bahrain to Saudi Arabia.
According to Atlantic Magazine, from there he was smuggled along the Gulf in a fisherman's boat to Kuwait.
He crossed into Iraq and took a regularly scheduled flight to London, where the magazine says he was granted asylum.
A source close to Abdulemam's family confirmed to the BBC that he had arrived in London.
Critical blogs
Abdulemam's troubles began when he started to write articles critical of the ruling Al Khalifa family.
The Al Khalifas are Sunni Muslim in a country with a Shia Muslim majority. Shia have long complained of discrimination.
Abdulemam worked as an IT specialist for the Bahraini airline Gulf Air. In his spare time he blogged.
But he was sacked from the airline after he was arrested in September 2010 and accused of being part of a terrorist organisation.
He was charged with spreading false information and linked to Bahraini opposition figures who had been arrested in August of that year.
Like Mr Abdulemam, all of the arrested men were Shia. Academics, a dentist, a geologist, and several clerics were among those held.
They all protested their innocence and were in fact pardoned by King Hamad and released in February 2011.
But following the crushing of the pro-democracy movement in March 2011, orders went out to re-arrest the men.
Ali Abdulemam went into hiding in Bahrain and managed to escape capture.
In an interview with the BBC in December 2010, his wife Jenan al-Oraibi told the BBC:
""Ali does not belong to any political party. He just writes his opinion. He has a free pen. That is exactly his crime. He has a free pen"".
Mr Abdulemam's flight from the kingdom will cause the government there some embarrassment.
Along with other GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) countries, Bahrain has cracked down hard on internet activism.

896,"But long before her stature on the small screen soared, Cilla was an unknown Liverpool lass with an astonishing rags to riches story.
Her early years are about to be relived in a new TV drama charting how Priscilla White was transformed into a chart-topping singing star.
It also chronicles the turbulent highs and lows from tasting fame to finding lasting love.
The three-part offering - simply called Cilla - presents actress Sheridan Smith with the onerous task of portraying the young woman who went on to become a national treasure.
We see her in early 1960s Liverpool, a grim city riven by religious prejudices where prospects were limited. Young people - including Cilla - escaped everyday life by going to see exciting new rock and roll bands at the Cavern Club.
Screenwriter Jeff Pope, who also co-scripted Oscar-nominated film Philomena, says the drama is ""a non-patronising look at the working class"".
""I thought the earlier part of Cilla's life would be interesting. We live in the X Factor age and I thought it was intriguing to see how Cilla had come up from literally nowhere and how she made it,"" he adds.
""But at its heart is a love story between Cilla and Bobby - and Cilla and Brian.""
The singer's rise in the drama is dominated by two men - Bobby, who went on to be the love of her life and was ""very happy to carry the handbag"" for such a successful woman, and music mogul Brian Epstein, who plucked Black from obscurity.
He died of an overdose in 1967 aged 34, and a side story of the TV mini-series is his tortured existence as a closeted gay man in the dark days before homosexuality was decriminalised in the year of his death.
West End performer Smith, whose collaboration with Pope on drama Mrs Biggs won her a Bafta, says the drama will bring the two halves of Cilla's career together.
""The younger generation who have got no clue about this and know about Blind Date will get to see this amazing singing career, and the older generation can relive it.""
The actress not only had to capture the essence of a youthful Cilla in her portrayal, but had to sing live for scenes from the frenetic buzz of the Cavern Club as 'Swinging Cilla' to the recording studios of Abbey Road.
""In the months leading up to shooting, I had every interview, every piece of footage from the early 60s and there was loads on YouTube so I sat there watching them,"" explains Smith.
""There's only one Cilla and everyone does an impression of her. I didn't want to do her a disservice and I'm not an impersonator. I wanted to try to get little mannerisms like the way she touched her hair.
""I had some singing lessons - I sing with my mouth wide open, she sings with it quite closed. I know I don't have her voice,"" she adds, pointing out that Cilla had a ""honk"" as well as much softer vocals.
The actress recounts how her role led to a dinner date with the star which made the weight of her burden become real.
""I was really star-struck and nervous and I babbled away at her. It's a huge responsibility and you don't want to let them down.
""She gave me her phone number but I was too shy to ring! What do you ask?!"" adds Smith. ""And I have no plans to make an album of covers - come on, there's only one Cilla!""
But she plays down the performance, saying it was all down to a simple prop synonymous with Cilla.
""I just had to whack my teeth in and I was away! They changed the shape of my mouth so it really helped with the accent.""
Pope, whose credits also include Fred West dramatisation Appropriate Adult and The Widower, says Cilla had an important role in creating the drama - and encouraged him to tease out the spikier side of her growth as a star.
The story clearly shows how she could be tough with those around her and was even a match for established artists like songwriter Burt Bacharach.
""She was very insistent that we go into areas that weren't viewed through rose-coloured spectacles. She was very upfront about how determined she was and how sharp her elbows were and had to be in those days.
""Would her tendency be, like her TV shows, to smooth everything out and present a wonderful face to the world? I found the opposite,"" he says.
""She was in a man's world and I admire her strength,"" adds Smith.
The writer said watching the films with a figure who remains alive and well was ""stressful"", not to mention filled with memories.
""Cilla made a joke out of it and said 'this normally happens when someone kicks the bucket.' The emotion of seeing the love of her life [who died in 1999] was massive.""
Cilla's story finishes before her marriage to Bobby in 1969 and after the peak of her musical fame. Tellingly, a contract for a BBC television show is found beside the body of Epstein, hinting at the beginnings of a small screen star we all know and love.
Cilla begins on ITV on Monday 15 September at 2100 BST.","Popular entertainer Cilla Black became best known for her huge television hits Blind Date and Surprise Surprise, which dominated the airwaves in the 1980s and 90s.",28852517
897,"That is what many environmentalists are asking after the United States delivered a damaging blow to India's ambitious solar power programme this week.
In response to a US complaint, a World Trade Organization (WTO) panel has ruled that India's National Solar Mission breaches trade rules.
It judged that India's policies on buying locally made solar power equipment discriminates against imports.
""The ink is barely dry on the UN Paris Climate Agreement, but clearly trade still trumps real action on climate change,"" Sam Cossar-Gilbert of Friends of the Earth International said in a statement.
But is the decision really as damaging as many commentators seem to think?
Let's start at the beginning.
One of the biggest achievements at the Paris climate change conference was drawing India into the architecture of international climate agreements.
It refused to commit to a ceiling on carbon dioxide emissions but did promise big increases in the carbon efficiency of the economy - the amount of carbon emitted per unit of GDP.
A key part of that commitment was the promise of huge investment in renewable technologies, including a vast increase in solar power.
India said it would add 100 GW of solar capacity by 2022.
That's more than the current solar capacity of the world's top five solar-producing countries combined.
And - you guessed it - the National Solar Mission was the centrepiece of the whole shebang.
But while the US was carefully reeling India into the climate talks it had simultaneously lodged a complaint with the WTO, arguing that India's solar programme created unfair barriers to the import of US-made solar panels.
It is certainly true that India's plans include a ""buy local"" policy.
The Solar Mission is explicitly designed to make India one of the biggest players in the rapidly growing international solar industry.
Indeed, developing solar is a key thrust of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's signature ""Make in India"" policy.
And here's where the interesting economic arguments come in.
Because the presumption in most of the commentaries I've read on this is that buying local content is necessarily a good thing.
Take a look at this article in the online environmental magazine Grist, or this piece in the Huffington Post, which maintains: ""The ruling shows that decades-old, over-reaching trade rules are out of sync with the global challenge to 100% clean energy.""
Lots of economists would say that that is muddle-headed.
Think about what the ""buy local"" rules are really about.
They are there to shield local capitalists - Indian-based solar panel companies - from competition from abroad.
That means one of two things.
Secure behind the protective barrier, they get to pocket extra profits.
Alternatively they are able to run less efficient businesses.
Either way the people who buy the panels lose out because they end up paying more.
The case is made very well in this Forbes article, which argues that the WTO rules are there to right an inherent imbalance between producers and consumers.
The problem is that local businesses tend to feel very strongly indeed about creating that comfortable competition-free space, so they lobby government hard for it.
Their customers aren't so motivated to make a fuss so the manufacturers tend to win out.
That's where the WTO agreements come in, tilting the trade disputes like this in favour of consumers.
That is why - runs the argument - the WTO ruling against India will actually have huge environmental benefits.
The WTO is ensuring that India's solar ambitions are achieved in the most efficient way possible because the Indian businesses that want to generate solar power get to buy the cheapest solar panels.
That is certainly what the American solar industry says.
""This decision helps us bring clean energy to the people of India, as that nation's demand for electricity rapidly grows,"" Dan Whitten of the Solar Energy Industries Association told PV-Tech magazine.
India, of course, disagrees.
It argues that developing an indigenous solar industry will in time boost international competition and therefore reduce the price of solar panels for everyone.
And no doubt India will be tempted to point to the hypocrisy in US trade policy.
While the US argues for unfettered free markets in international forums like the WTO, it doesn't practice what it preaches at home.
Half of all US states have subsidies for renewables.
Perhaps India should file a counter-complaint with the WTO against the US.",Whatever happened to all the talk of international co-operation to tackle climate change that we heard during the climate conference in Paris just a few months ago?,35668342

899,"The 24-year-old former University of Missouri athlete revealed his sexuality on Sunday.
Mrs Obama took to Twitter to call Sam ""an inspiration to all of us"".
The National Football League has also welcomed the defensive lineman's announcement, saying Sam has ""honesty and courage"".
Mrs Obama said of Sam: ""We couldn't be prouder of your courage both on and off the field.""
In the interview that aired on ESPN on Sunday, Sam said: ""I came to tell the world I'm an openly gay man.
Sam's form in his final season as a college footballer saw him named defensive player of the year in the Southeastern Conference, widely considered the top league in college football. His university team mates, who knew he was gay, voted him their most valuable player.
""If I work hard, if I make plays - that's all that should matter.""
The athlete completed his college football career in December and is expected to be drafted by an NFL franchise in May.
He is said to have revealed his sexuality to his former college teammates at the University of Missouri's Mizzou Tigers, but admitted doing so publicly was ""a weight off his chest"".
""I probably may be the first but I won't be the last,"" he added. ""And I think only good things will come from this.""
Former college coach Gary Pinkel supported Sam on Monday, telling US media the athlete is ""a great example of just how important it is to be respectful of others"".
""He's taught a lot of people here first hand that it doesn't matter what your background is, or your personal orientation, we're all on the same team and we all support each other,"" Mr Pinkel added.
Should Sam be drafted as expected and make an NFL roster in the 2014 season, he would become the first openly gay player to compete in any of North America's four major professional sports leagues - football, baseball, basketball and hockey.
However, Sports Illustrated quotes anonymous coaches and scouts as saying that Sam's NFL draft outlook will now be adversely affected.
""In blunt terms, they project a significant drop in Sam's draft stock, a publicity circus and an NFL locker room culture not prepared to deal with an openly gay player,"" says the report.
In April 2013, basketball player Jason Collins came out during the sport's off-season but was not signed for the next campaign, meaning he never competed as an openly gay player.
Sam is expected to be a mid-draft pick when the NFL's teams hold their annual draft meeting, a process where players from America's college football system are signed for professional franchises.
Former players from the league have come out since retiring, but none have done so during their careers.
In a statement, the NFL said: ""Michael is a football player. Any player with ability and determination can succeed in the NFL.
""We look forward to welcoming and supporting Michael Sam in 2014.""","American footballer Michael Sam, who aims to become the NFL's first openly gay player, has won praise from First Lady Michelle Obama.",26127936

Cronenberg, who was not part of the second film, first talked about writing a new version of the film back in 2009 and confirmed in 2011 he had written a script.
Shortly after, he revealed 20th Century Fox was not interested and later explained it was ""a budget problem"".
Goldblum said he was keen to team up with Cronenberg again, as he ""was satisfied with the very nourishing collaboration we had, but it would be dreamy to work with him"".
""I'd like to see anything he did really,"" he said.
The actor is currently starring in another sequel, Independence Day: Resurgence, which picks up 20 years after the blockbuster hit.
It sees Goldblum reprise his role as David Levinson, who is now in charge of Earth's space defences following the alien invasion of the first film.
Liam Hemsworth also stars in the movie, with many of the original's cast returning including Bill Pullman, Vivica Fox and Brent Spiner.
Independence Day took more than $800m (Â£545.6m) globally when it was released in 1996, but Goldblum said the new film was not an attempt to cash in on that success.
""All the creators were highly respectful of the audience that enjoyed the first one so much and shelled out their hard-earned money,"" he said.

The group have ""no other choice except to take it upon ourselves to do something to find answers and closure,"" it said.
Campaigner Grace Subathirai Nathan, whose mother was on the plane, told the Associated Press news agency that she would be making the self-funded journey with six other MH370 relatives - three from Malaysia, two from China and one from France.
Responding to criticism of delays in retrieving suspected debris in September, the Malaysian authorities said they were acting on possible discoveries and that everyone should ""allow the experts to conduct the verification processes"".
There were 239 people on board the missing jet, which is thought to have likely crashed into the southern Indian Ocean.
An Australian-led search in the area has yet to find any trace of the plane and is due to be suspended early next year unless it makes a significant new discovery.",Relatives of those on board Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 are to travel to Madagascar to search for debris that might provide clues to the plane's fate.,38047793

909,"McInally, 26, has had to settle for a bench role so far this season despite starting Scotland's last two Tests, in Japan, when Ford was injured.
But he will get a first start of the campaign away to Munster on Saturday.
""I just have to respect the man I have ahead of me in the starting jersey at the moment,"" he told BBC Scotland.
""I think the world of him. We get on really well and he has taught me a lot over the last few years, and not just about throwing or scrummaging.
""I see how hard he works in terms of the extra stuff he does and how early he comes in to do his extra fitness or rehab.
""I have realised that I needed to work as hard as that, if not harder. And it is hard to work harder than Ross, because he works exceptionally hard.
""Certainly over the last couple of years I have upped my attention to the little things. I come in a bit earlier to do a bit extra here and there because I know the challenge there is to get ahead of him.
""He has got 99 caps for his country, he is an exceptional player. But obviously I want that jersey, and I am just so eager to get out there and play.""
McInally has won nine Scotland caps in the last 13 months - six off the bench - after making the positional switch from flanker to hooker three years ago.
Saturday's trip to Munster's atmospheric Thomond Park - a challenge he describes as ""right up there"" in Pro12 terms - brings back mixed emotions. ""Playing there has been enjoyable, but sometimes it has been a nightmare as well,"" he recalls.
Two years ago Alan Solomons' side earned a one-point victory at the storied stadium on the first day of the season, but McInally was not involved - on the field anyway. ""I was helping with the commentary for BBC Alba, so I was admiring it from their studio, unfortunately.""
In 2012 McInally was in the back row when Edinburgh travelled there for a group fixture in the old Heineken Cup, the season after they reached the semi-finals.
""I think we were 6-0 down at half-time, and taking it right to them,"" he said.  ""We ended up losing 33-0. It was awful.  I hate those moments.  That is what drives me and motivates me to play well because I hate losing.  I will be doing everything I can to make sure that doesn't happen again.""
To avoid a repeat scenario on Saturday, McInally - who is co-captain of Edinburgh this season along with Grant Gilchrist - is in no doubt where the team's priorities lie after last Friday's disappointing home defeat by Leinster.
""We just need to go there and put right the wrongs from last week,"" he added. ""Our defence is nowhere near where we need to be as a standard - that has been made abundantly clear by Peter (Wilkins), our defence coach.
""The players take that to heart and we've been working hard this week to get better.  There has been a lot of chat, but the proof will be in the pudding when we get out there, and how we react.

It's not Hollywood, baby, but it's enough. For Clark, the job of trying to drag the team out of their annual grind against the drop is the only thing that matters.
What strikes you about Clark is his intensity, his raging desire to make things work at Killie where he has a virtually brand new team on his hands and an Everest to climb to try to tie it all together. ""Absolute faith"" is a favourite expression.
He says he eats and sleeps football, has done since he was a boy growing up in the east end of Newcastle.
""I come from a tough part of the city, a place called Walker,"" he explains. ""Two sisters and a brother. My father worked on the building sites, my mother had various jobs to keep things ticking over and they made me the person I am. I'm not a quitter. I like to think that I'm tough.
""As a player, I was honest, I gave my best. I had to think quicker than others because I didn't have huge pace. I could pass and create but above of all I had a never-say-die attitude.
""I know I was a handful at times. I'm not sure that Lee Clark the manager could have handled Lee Clark the player. He was just an absolute hot-head on occasion. There were many, many times when I blew up. I could be the nicest lad off the pitch, but on the pitch I could go crazy. I would have hated managing me.""
You put it to the test and ask if he'd like to have his younger self at the heart of his Kilmarnock midfield.
""On reflection, aye,"" he smiles. ""He'd be useful. He'd be well up for it.""
Clark's career has been a fascinating one. He made his Newcastle debut at 17. Ossie Ardiles became his manager. Ardiles believed in young players and pitched them into his side in great numbers. Newcastle didn't get consistency, but they unearthed some talent.
""We played against Tranmere in what was called the Zenith Data Cup and it finished 6-6. That kinda summed up Ossie. We were naive but we were entertaining and some foundations were put in place for what Kevin [Keegan] did afterwards.
""Here at Kilmarnock I've done a similar thing to Ossie. I did it at Huddersfield as well. Young players. Freshness and dynamism. I have to show the same faith in them that Ossie showed in me and seven or eight of my team-mates.
""Some of our new players from down south are not used to this type of football. They're used to more technical stuff, not the in-your-face aggression of up here. Plus, a few of them have never been away from home before. They're experiencing what that's like as well. They're learning that to win a game of football, it's not just about ability, it's about a battle.
""You have to man-up, you have to fight your way through it. It's the players who are strong mentally who'll survive.""
That was never a problem for Clark. He laughs now when he talks about his youngest son, Bobby, who is 11 and is in the Newcastle academy. Bobby was never quite sure whether to believe his father when he told him that he used to play for the club. Then the young man was shown around the place and found his dad's picture on the walls and went, 'Ah, so it's true!'
Clark almost achieved immortality at Newcastle under Keegan in that famous season of 1995-96. At his next club, the Geordies' arch-rivals, Sunderland, he achieved notoriety.
He had two fine years there - getting promoted to the Premier League in one of them - but exited under a cloud. Newcastle played Manchester United in the 1999 FA Cup final and Clark had arranged to meet some mates in a pub on Baker Street in London beforehand.
When he got out of a taxi, he was spotted by Newcastle fans who pulled a t-shirt over his head and started taking pictures.
""There was a derogatory slogan about Sunderland fans on it,"" recalls Clark. ""I had it on for about 30 seconds but the cameras were flashing for fun. When the pictures got out, that was the end of my time at Sunderland.
""A big regret. Huge. I would love to go back to the Stadium of Light and for them to appreciate me for the two great years we had, but there's a bit of hatred there now from the fans.""
He entered the wonderful world of Al-Fayed's Fulham and loved his six years there. He won a First Division title in 2001 and, under Jean Tigana, finished ninth in the Premier League. ""A great period in my life,"" he says.
Clark's first step into management was at Huddersfield in late 2008. They were entertaining, broke club records for unbeaten runs and goals scored [he signed Jordan Rhodes from Ipswich and made him an £8m player], but fell agonisingly short of promotion to the Championship two seasons running.
""What gives me hope at Killie is what we did at Huddersfield,"" he says. ""We built a young team, went 43 games unbeaten at one stage and came very close to promotion. On the day I lost my job we had three defeats in 55 games. That's life. The queue of lads that came to see me to say goodbye was humbling.
""Jordan was one of those. A wonderful kid. There's a picture I have on my wall at home of me embracing Jordan after a game at Sheffield Wednesday. We drew 4-4 and Jordan got all four.""
He said he a choice at that point to buckle or to fight - and he fought. He became Birmingham City manager in June 2012 but it did not work. The club's owner, Carson Yeung, had been arrested for money laundering a year before - he was later sentenced to four years in prison - and the club was in financial limbo and forced to sell its best players. He was sacked in October 2014.
Five days later he joined Blackpool. ""My silly ego got the better of me. The club was bottom of the league and I thought I could turn it around. I quickly realised I couldn't.
""It was an unhappy place. Fans were demonstrating about the owners and it got very nasty. The atmosphere was poor and we went out of the league with a whimper. I resigned (May 2015) and then took some time out to take stock. Then I got the opportunity to come to Kilmarnock.
""Will it take time to get the club up the table on a consistent basis? Yes. Do managers always get time? No, but I'm hopeful. I want top half of the league. I don't to be always seen as a fire-fighter. I want to get back to where I was at Huddersfield where we were always looking up and striving rather than looking down and worrying.
""I've always said that it's not how people perceive you when you come through the door, it's how they perceive you when you go out.""
Can this driven Geordie turn Kilmarnock around? He answers: ""A lot of people would say no and that's understandable.

913,"Shaw was chopped down by Hector Moreno before being carried off early on.
After a long delay, Memphis Depay scored a weaving opener on his return to PSV, but in first-half injury time Moreno headed in from a corner.
PSV's Luciano Narsingh headed in a 57th-minute winner despite United dominating for long periods.
Unlike previous games this season where Louis van Gaal's side have struggled to turn their superiority into chances, they chalked up 17 shots on goal to PSV's six.
There were encouraging displays from Depay, who scored his third of the season, and Anthony Martial, who made his full debut following his wonder goal during the win over Liverpool last Saturday.
Poor finishing let the visitors down, although their biggest concern will be over Shaw who will now suffer a lengthy lay-off.
United started the game well but after 15 minutes they were rocked by the injury to Shaw, who has made a positive start to his second season at Old Trafford.
The England full-back burst into the box after riding two challenges, but as he bore down on goal he was scythed down by Moreno and from the Mexico defender's immediate reaction, it was clear that the injury to Shaw was serious.
Replays showed that his right leg appeared to be broken and after 10 minutes of treatment the 20-year-old was taken off on a stretcher to sympathetic applause from the PSV fans.
There was no punishment for Moreno, who equalised in first-half stoppage time.
With a lengthy absence to come, left-back Shaw's inclusion in the England squad at Euro 2016 must be in some doubt.
Depay may not have scored in the Premier League so far, but fresh from his £31m move from PSV to Manchester United in June, the 21-year-old looked at home on his return to the Philips Stadium.
The forward, who scored 22 league goals for PSV en route to the Eredivisie title last season, started down the left and linked up well with striker Martial, who showed no signs of nervousness despite his tender age of 19 and his £36m transfer fee.
Depay's goal was not dissimilar to Martial's effort at Old Trafford against Liverpool. Played through by Daley Blind, he cut inside, and beat Jeroen Zoet with some ease. When the scores were level, the Dutchman could have added to his tally after a smart one-two with Martial but struck straight at the PSV goalkeeper.
In addition to their profligacy in front of goal, United were also guilty of contributing to both PSV goals. The first, which came from Moreno's header, bounced off Blind's head and wrong-footed Ashley Young, who was well placed to stop the initial effort on the goalline.
The second was well taken by Narsingh, who headed in a delightful left-wing cross by Maxime Lestienne, but Matteo Darmian was guilty of giving the ball away in his own half.
There was plenty of time to recover, and Depay had several chances to double his tally despite switching onto the right side during the second half.
Juan Mata was perhaps guilty of the worst miss by failing to control a chipped ball by Bastian Schweinsteiger.
There was plenty of encouragement for Van Gaal's side, who will face Wolfsburg at Old Trafford on 30 September before travelling to CSKA Moscow on 21 October, and Martial gave them added power and pace up front.
But they will be disappointed not to have earned at least a point on their return to the Champions League after a year's absence.
Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal: ""It's the same game as against Swansea. We are dominating the game, we are creating chances and we are not finishing. The first chance they have, the corner kick, they scored.
""The second goal, we were attacking and then we lose the ball in the first phase and they scored. It's fantastic for PSV but for us it is very bad.""

914,"Councils in England and Wales were said to be male dominated, with women and ethnic minorities under-represented.
The Fawcett Society and Local Government Information Unit recommend statutory maternity leave, funding childcare and allowing councillors to attend and vote remotely.
Councils said ""faster progress"" was needed, without ""imposing structures"".
The report, which draws on online surveys, feedback from public meetings and interviews with female council leaders, concluded that local government in England and Wales was ""stuck in the past"".
Among its headline findings are that one in three local councillors are female, women account for just 17% of top council jobs while men outnumber women by six to one in terms of jobs in finance and resources departments.
While women make up 78% of the local authority workforce, they account for just a third of chief executives. Of the 35 county, unitary and metropolitan councils in England that had elections in May, only two of them - Oxfordshire and Durham - elected more than 40% women.
In Wales, female representation was below 20% in Blaenau Gwent, Ceredigion, Merthyr Tydfil, Newport, Pembrokeshire, Wrexham and Anglesey.
The report identifies significant barriers to entry for women, particularly those with young children and caring responsibilities. Of the 353 councils in England, only 4% have any kind of maternity, paternity or parental leave policy in place.
While the report found some councils have informal arrangements for their elected officials, many of whom are unpaid volunteers, it had learnt of ""unacceptable"" stories of women being told they would lose their cabinet positions if they became pregnant.
""We call on government to introduce a nationwide policy and end this scandal,"" it said.
Councillors are not paid a formal salary but they are given allowances to compensate them for their time spent on council business, varying from a couple of thousand pounds a year to Â£20,000 or more.
The report calls for councils in England to offer a year's maternity leave or shared parental leave to councillors, in line with that available to direct employees, with the guarantee that officials would not be discriminated against for not attending a meeting for six months.
Cabinet officers with executive responsibilities, who often manage multi-billion pounds budgets, should retain all their allowances while on leave.
The Fawcett Society said the paucity of women of child-bearing age currently in executive positions meant the cost of the policy would not be huge and even if half of all council leaders were women and took 12 months off, it would cost about Â£3.8m.
Among the report's other recommendations are:
The report suggests that many councils have working cultures reminiscent of the 1970s where sexual harassment goes ""unchallenged and unchecked"". Codes of conduct, are needed, to address sexism and discrimination with proper complaints and disciplinary procedures, it says.
Its findings were described as ""shocking"" by Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge, a former leader of Islington Council who co-chaired a year-long investigation into the issue of female participation funded by the Barrow Cadbury Trust, whose work informed the report.
She said: ""The way councils do business is still designed by, and for, men. This needs to change and fast.""
The Fawcett Society said at current rates of progress, it would take about 50 years to secure gender equality in county councils while the picture was scarcely better in the combined authorities created since 2011.
""We are going backwards and that is fundamentally unacceptable in the 21st Century,"" said its chief executive Sam Smethers.
But the Local Government Information Unit said there was good practice in many councils which needed to be adopted more widely.
The Local Government Association, which represents more than 300 councils in England and Wales, said it was supporting a range of initiatives to encourage women and other under-represented groups to become involved in local politics.
LGA vice chair Marianne Overton said the report ""rightly identifies that progress must be made at a faster pace"".
She added: ""Local government must be at the forefront of driving change, but it will be important to get the balance right between changing culture and imposing structures.
""Change will also require all political parties, no matter the colour of their rosette, to fully engage and support a wide range of aspiring councillors.""","Sexism and discrimination is widespread in local government and often goes ""unchallenged"", a new report claims.",40580158
915,"The 25-year-old said: ""I've complained to the WBA and IBF [who] in the next 24 hours will tell me who he is.
""On tape you see him around Peterson's corner celebrating. It's bad for boxing we want fair fights and justice.""
The WBA official who Khan alleges was interfered with has refused to tell the BBC who the man sat next to him was.
On Thursday Khan accused an unidentified man of ""interfering"" with officials and the judges' scorecards on his Twitter page by posting a number of images from last month's fight in Washington.
The Bolton fighter claimed the man talked to WBA supervisor Michael Welsh and interfered with the judges' scorecards.
However, when contacted by BBC Sport, Welsh refused to answer any questions about the mystery man or what was said.
""I want to know who this man is,"" Khan added on Sky Sports News.
""He had no accreditation. At the end of the fight he was straight over Peterson's people, celebrating with them.
""There were lots of amendments made on the scorecards, which I've never seen before. Why did it take so long to get the cards out?""
Khan's business manager, Asif Vali, said that they had written to the boxing authorities for explanations to several areas of concern.
""We did the table plan with Golden Boy Promotions and the WBA official was already in his seat and the IBF official was already in his seat, so who is this person?"" he asked.
""What's he doing talking to the WBA? Why is he handling the slips?
""These are legitimate questions and if they give us sufficient reasons for it then I'll accept it. I want to see what the reasons are.
""We're not saying there is foul play involved in any way, shape or form. I just need the answers for the sequence of events that have taken place. Nothing else.
""I'm not accusing any of the bodies. Lamont Peterson is the champion and good luck to him for 2012.""
My take is that Amir Khan is really stunned by the loss and he looking for excuses to try to explain it away. If there were people who thought there was wrongdoing or thought the scoring in the fight was off, they would have been screaming murder. That happens all the time with fights in the United States, regardless of the nationality of the fighters. There has been no such outcry here. Khan is really making himself look back. It's very flimsy what he's putting out to back up his claims
Khan's appeal against the controversial points decision to hometown fighter Peterson, which cost him his WBA and IBF light-welterweight titles, will be held later this month.
The president of the WBA, Gilberto Mendoza, has told BBC Sport that he is examining Khan's Twitter allegations and will make a response to Khan's camp within the next 24 hours.
The IBF told BBC Sport that ""with regards to the IBF master scorecard we can assure that it has not been tampered with"".
Among a string of tweets, Khan alleged that the unidentified man started to ""interfere"" with Welsh in round six and continued to do so until the end of the fight.
He also claims that the man talked to Welsh and handled the scorecards, which were handed to Welsh at the end of each round, and that Welsh admitted after the fight that his scorecards did not match the others.
Last month Khan had told of his unhappiness with the performance of referee Joe Cooper - who deducted Khan two points for pushing - and alleged scorecard irregularities.
Khan's trainer, Freddie Roach, told BBC Sport he believes his charge ""got screwed"".
Roach said he wanted to see Cooper suspended from officiating future world title fights and that ""the fight should 100% be looked into"".

""I have no knowledge of any wrongdoing but it was unusual how long it took [for the scorecards to be tallied],"" said Roach, Khan's trainer since 2008.

The UN says about 18,000 Palestinian refugees are inside the camp.
IS militants have seized large swathes of territory in eastern Syria and across northern and western Iraq.
But this is the group's first major attack near the heart of the Syrian capital.
Yarmouk residents told BBC Arabic that members of Aknaf Beit al-Maqdis, a group formed by Palestinian militiamen opposed to the Syrian government, were leading the fight against the IS militants, along with some Free Syrian Army fighters.
IS fighters had seized control of large parts of the camp, an official with the Palestine Liberation Organisation based in Damascus, and the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said.
There has been no official statement from IS about the move.
Unrwa, a UN relief agency for Palestinian refugees, said in a statement that the fighting would place Yarmouk's civilians, including large numbers of children, ""at extreme risk of death, serious injury, trauma and displacement"".
It demanded an end to the fighting and ""a return to conditions that will enable its staff to support and assist Yarmouk's civilians"".
Analysis: Lina Sinjab, BBC News, Beirut
Members of the self-proclaimed Islamic State stormed into the southern side of Yarmouk camp in the early hours of the morning and clashed with the Palestinian brigade, Aknaf Beit al-Maqdis.
Reports suggest they came in from the area of Hajar al-Aswad in the south of the capital.
The Palestinian Ambassador to Damascus, Anwar Abdulhadi, told the BBC that the group had seized the area of the camp near the Palestine Hospital.
Most information is coming from Palestinian officials in areas under government control.
The attack comes days before a deal to ease the humanitarian situation for civilians in the camp was set to come into operation.

The battle between forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, rebels opposed to his rule and jihadist militants from Islamic State has also driven more than 11 million people from their homes.
The al-Qaeda linked al-Nusra Front captured the north-western city of Idlib from government forces on Saturday. It is only the second provincial centre to fall into rebel hands since IS seized Raqqa in March 2013.
Al-Nusra Front said on Wednesday that the city would now be ruled under Sharia, but that the group did not intend to monopolise power in the city.
Also on Wednesday, Jordan closed its only official border crossing with Syria due to fierce clashes between Syrian rebels and government troops.
Jordanian authorities said the Nasib border crossing, in the north of the country, had been closed as a preventative measure to protect travellers.
First built for Palestinians fleeing the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, Yarmouk was once considered by many to be the de facto capital of the Palestinian refugee diaspora.
Prior to the Syrian civil war, it had more than 150,000 refugees living there, and its own mosques, schools and public buildings.
However, the camp has been besieged by fighting between government troops and rebel forces since 2012.
Unrwa says about 18,000 refugees remain trapped in the camp, with inadequate access to food supplies, clean water and electricity.
In March, Unrwa said: ""The extreme hardship faced by Palestine refugees in Yarmouk, but also in other locations in Syria as a result of the armed conflict is, from a human point of view, unacceptable.""","Islamic State (IS) militants have entered the Palestinian refugee camp Yarmouk in Damascus, activists and Palestinian officials say.",32147888

The 33-year-old has offered to continue as Test skipper on an interim basis to aid transition to a new captain.
In a statement on the Sri Lanka cricket website, Sangakkara said his decision was made ""in the best long-term interests of the team"".
""A new leader can be properly groomed for the 2015 World Cup,"" he added.
Wicketkeeper-batsman Sangakkara, who succeeded Mahela Jayawardene as captain in March 2009, is one of the most consistent players in world cricket, with an average of over 57 in 94 Tests and 38 in 291 one-day internationals.
He was one of the stars of the recent World Cup, scoring the third most runs (465), including 48 in their six-wicket final loss to co-hosts India in the final in Mumbai in Mumbai.
I have no plans of retirement from international cricket at this stage and subject to form and fitness I would like to be considered for selection in all three formats of the game for the foreseeable future
Sangakkara insisted his decision to resign the captaincy was made prior to the start of the World Cup.
""I will be 37 by the next World Cup and I cannot therefore be sure of my place in the team. It is better that Sri Lanka is led now by a player who will be at the peak of their career during that tournament,"" he continued.
""It has been a true honour and a great privilege to serve my country as captain during the past two years and, although bitterly disappointed that we could not win the final, I am very proud of the performances of the team.
""I met with the selectors yesterday and I explained my reasons for my decision and I assured them of my fullest support in helping our new captain settle into the leadership.
""In this regard, I have offered to continue as the Test captain for the forthcoming series with England [which starts in Cardiff on 26 May] and possibly Australia if the selectors believe this would help the new captain and aid the transition.

Eloquent and articulate, Sangakkara is seen as an excellent ambassador for his country, according to the BBC's Charles Haviland in Colombo.
He won warm acclaim for the grace with which he as captain accepted defeat to India in the World Cup final and for the praise he gave to Sri Lanka's victorious opponents.
All-rounders Tillakaratne Dilshan and Angelo Mathews are among those tipped to take charge of the limited-overs sides, while batsman Thilan Samaraweera is being discussed as an option to lead the Test team.

Voters were asked to choose first and second preferences for mayor, and two types of London Assembly member - one for their area and one for the city.
Of the votes for the city, UKIP gained two seats while both the Conservatives and Lib Dems lost one each.
The 11 members voted in are:
The best performing of the smaller parties was the Women's Equality Party.
Party leader Sophie Walker said Mr Khan would have to focus on the gender pay gap in London.
""We opened our doors to membership 10 months ago and look where we are now. We are here for good.

919,"Felipe Flores was arrested in Iguala, in the southern state of Guerrero, where the incident happened.
The government says the students were arrested by police before being handed over to a drugs cartel who killed them and incinerated their bodies.
But families and independent experts contest this claim.
The panel of experts, working for the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, said the account that the students had been burnt beyond identification at a rubbish dump was physically impossible.
Felipe Flores was police chief of Iguala when the incident took place on 26 September 2014, and his arrest may offer new clues as to what exactly happened then.
Attorney General Arely Gomez welcomed Felipe Flores' capture, writing on Twitter that it would allow investigators to get ""a fundamental statement to clear up the events"".
The case has tainted President Enrique Pena Nieto's image.
The 43 were all students at an all-male teacher training college in the town of Aytozinapa, in south-western Guerrero state. The college has a history of left-wing activism and the students regularly took part in protests.
They disappeared from the nearby town of Iguala on the evening of 26 September 2014 after a confrontation between municipal police and the students during which six people were killed.
Independent forensic experts have matched charred bone fragments reportedly found at a rubbish dump near Iguala to Alexander Mora, one of the 43 missing students. They also say there is a high probability another set of remains could belong to Jhosivani Guerrero de la Cruz, another of the students. However, experts from the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights say the chain of evidence was broken and they could not be sure the bone fragments had been found at the dump.
According to the official report, the students were seized by corrupt municipal police officers who handed them over to members of a local drugs gang. The drugs gang mistook the students for members of a rival gang, killed them and burned their bodies at the dump before throwing their ashes into a nearby stream.
They think officials have failed to investigate the role soldiers from a nearby barracks may have played in the students' disappearance. The government has refused to let the soldiers, who were in the area at the time of the disappearance, be questioned by anyone but government prosecutors. The families also point to the report by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights which said that there was no evidence the bodies of the 43 were burned at the dump.","The former police chief of the Mexican city where 43 students disappeared in 2014 has been detained after two years on the run, officials say.",37735267

921,"Deputy Steve Luce has called on farmers and landowners to cut the use of fertiliser, which can increase nitrate levels, by up to 10%.
Nitrate is a form of nitrogen that is a natural part of soil and groundwater.
Long-term exposure to high levels of nitrate can cause stomach cancer, thyroid problems and blue baby syndrome.
Using fertilisers can increase levels and tests have shown nitrate levels in Jersey drinking water are higher than recommended.
In Jersey it is estimated about 4,000 homes with boreholes and wells have a water supply higher than the EU and Island limit of 50mg per litre for nitrates.
Levels in mains water, which has been treated, also regularly exceeded the limit in the last 14 years.
Deputy Luce said he was working with farmers and Jersey Water to tackle the problem but has also called on home owners to think twice before using fertiliser.
He said: ""Private and public drinking water supplies, recreational water use, fisheries and shellfish production, and of course the 'green weed' problem are all affected by nitrate levels.""
President of the Jersey Farmers' Union Graham Le Lay, said he would continue to work with the States in reducing nitrate levels.
He said: ""The environment minister can rest assured that the Jersey Farmers' Union will continue to encourage and assist farmers in finding ways to reduce nitrate fertiliser use.
""We would urge him to take immediate steps to make all land users aware that they too have to reduce their use of both inorganic and organic fertilisers on their allotments, vegetable gardens and lawns.""","Nitrate levels in Jersey's water need to be reduced, according to the environment minister.",32961325
922,"He urged David Cameron ""to end the pretence"" of EU renegotiation and back an ""out"" vote at the referendum.
Dr Fox also said cabinet members should be able to campaign for an EU exit without having to resign - despite disagreeing with the prime minister.
But former Tory prime minister Sir John Major said it would be ""extraordinary"" if ministers chose to break ranks now.
Mr Cameron has promised to hold an in-out referendum on EU membership before the end of 2017.
The prime minister said on Friday the UK would ""fundamentally change"" its relationship with the EU in 2016, following talks with fellow leaders in Brussels.
But Eurosceptics say his demands are trivial and will not have any impact on levels of migration to the UK from elsewhere in Europe.
What does Britain want from Europe?
Cameron hints at 2016 referendum
Dr Fox told the Sunday Times the sight of Mr Cameron taking ""the political begging bowl around European capitals"" to secure only minor reforms should be enough to persuade people to back a ""Brexit"".
He also told the BBC's Andrew Marr show the recent decision to create a single EU-wide border force was a critical moment.
""This is a force that will be deployed by the [European] Commission, not by elected governments, and in fact, can be done against the will of sovereign governments.
""That for me is the clearest possible indication about the direction of travel of Europe and I can't accept that.""
According to reports in several newspapers, some senior ministers are prepared to resign if they are not allowed to campaign to leave from inside the cabinet.
Dr Fox said individuals should be able ""to express what's effectively a matter of conscience for them"" without resigning.
""I think that the more that we're able to give freedom to our colleagues and treat one another's views with respect, the easier I think it will be for us to come together after that referendum to continue to govern to country.""
But Sir John told the BBC it would be extraordinary if anybody decided to campaign against cabinet policy - at least until Mr Cameron had completed his negotiations.
""I would hope afterwards that they would not wish to, because the unity of the argument for the sake of the country is very important,"" he continued.
""This is bigger than the Conservative Party. People deserve to hear a clear-cut argument, not an internecine piece of party strife.""
Steve Baker MP - co-chairman of campaign group Conservatives for Britain, which wants far-reaching EU reform - told Sky News there would be ""something of a pantomime for several months"" if ministers were forced to toe the line.
""I think it is inevitable that some members of the cabinet will feel they have to resign if they are browbeaten into supporting a deal this flimsy.""
But pro-European former minister Ken Clarke told Sky News it was perfectly possible for different branches of the Conservative Party to have a ""sensible"" and ""rational"" debate.
""Euroscepticism is, I think, a euphemism for right-wing nationalism, but that doesn't mean I don't think that some of them are quite intelligent and sensible and perfectly nice right-wing nationalists.""
Mr Cameron is demanding change on four issues, including stopping migrants from the EU from receiving in-work benefits in the UK until they have been in the country for four years.
Sir John said the renegotiation ""embraces many of the things"" Eurosceptics have long campaigned for, so it was ""essentially bogus"" to argue that the reforms were trivial.
He also questioned whether opting out of the EU would help reduce immigration.
""If we had control of our own borders I wonder what would happen to all the people who had got into Calais.
""Would the French keep them there, or would they say, 'This is no longer our problem?""
Sir John said it was ""a fantasy"" to believe the UK could become ""a closed nation"".
""Of course we will survive [if we leave]... the point is, would we be as safe? No. Would we be as well off? No. Would we be as influential? No.""
There are currently two campaigns advocating exit: Leave.EU and Vote Leave.
Dr Fox said they must speak with a united voice and he would happily share a platform with UKIP leader Nigel Farage.
""I think it has to become a question of the issue and not a question of personalities.""

923,"Camp residents and aid workers were among those killed when the air force bombed Rann, in Borno state, thinking it was a base of Boko Haram militants.
It was the biggest known botched attack in eight years of fighting the group.
The Nigerian army says it is engaged in a ""final push"" against the Islamists.
Commanders have apologised for the ""accidental"" bombing, which they said was because of ""the fog of war"".
Human Rights Watch said this did not absolve them of responsibility, and called for compensation for the victims.
A local government official from the area, Babagana Malarima, said a mistake had been made when it was earlier reported that the number of those killed had risen to 236.
The error had been made by those in the camp settlement who had added the number of dead to the number of injured to come up with the figure, he told the BBC.
In the immediate aftermath of the attack last Tuesday, the medical charity MSF said 52 people had died.
The wounded were treated in an MSF tented clinic as there are no hospitals in Rann, where displaced people are living in makeshift shelters.
An aid worker told the BBC that the attack, in which at least two bombs were dropped, caused terror and chaos at the camp.
He said he saw dead children lying on the ground, others left as orphans and terrible injuries among survivors.
Aid workers estimated 20,000-40,000 people had been sheltering in Rann, near the border with Cameroon, after fleeing attacks by Boko Haram.
The emergency services official, who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity, said all those who had died at Rann had now been buried.
Those critically injured were still receiving treatment in the state capital, Maiduguri, while others were being treated locally by international aid agencies and local services.
The Red Cross has said it has distributed food to more than 25,000 people in Rann since Saturday.
It said they had received enough rice, beans, oil, salt and corn soya blend to last for five weeks.
""People in Rann were happy to receive food. They have been isolated by rains and poor quality roads since June and running very low on food supplies,"" said Red Cross economic security coordinator Mohammed Sheikh-Ali.
""At the beginning of January, we laid sand bags on the road for our trucks to be able to cross. We got 12 trucks full of food to Rann last week on the day of the air strike, which prevented us [from distributing]. As soon as medical evacuations were over, we organised the distribution with the help of the community.""

A 17-year-old boy was charged with four counts of first-degree murder and seven counts of attempted murder on Saturday. Police said the male suspect cannot be named under Canada's Youth Criminal Justice Act.

After waiting nearly an hour, players used the pub table and drove Mr Burton in a supporter's car. His injury will be reassessed in the coming days.
East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS) said it had to prioritise cases.
Club captain Jonathan Hunt said they acted immediately after the injury on Saturday: ""On calling for an ambulance we were informed that none were available.
""At the very least a rapid responder might have been useful to administer some pain relief.

Mr Hunt said they were not criticising the emergency services - and praised Mr Burton care in hospital - but were shocked at how stretched resources were.
Mr Burton said his injury would be assessed once swelling had gone down, but he did not expect to play again this season.
Mark Gregory, paramedic and general manager at EMAS, said: ""We assess every 999 call to make sure we prioritise patients who are in a life-threatening emergency.

He said if Mr Cameron did not ""everyone will know he was acting as a cheerleader"" for the deal.
Mr Cameron said the government would ""back British jobs, British research and development and British science"".
Referring to the Kraft takeover of Cadbury's under the last Labour government, Mr Cameron said ministers were actively engaging with both Pfizer and AstraZeneca, ""because we know what happens when you stand back, just say you're opposed to everything - what you get is abject surrender and no guarantees for Britain"".
Mr Miliband said Labour would back the government if it chose to widen the public interest test to include science and research and development (R&D).
He asked Mr Cameron: ""Is he ruling out or ruling in the public interest test on this matter? We could make it happen. If he does not do it now everyone will know he was a cheerleader for the deal.""
""I think it's deeply sad that he makes accusations about cheerleading when the government was getting stuck in protecting British jobs,"" the Prime Minister responded.
""They wrote the rules. They sold the gold, they saw manufacturing in our country decline by one half and we will never take lectures from the people who wrecked our economy.""
The current public interest powers available to ministers allow them to intervene in takeover deals and mergers in a limited number of instances.
These include national security concerns, media company mergers and banks.
They do not give the government scope to address concerns about jobs or investment in research and development raised by the potential Pfizer takeover.
Earlier, Swedish finance minister Anders Borg told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that his country's experience of pledges from Pfizer had led him to be sceptical of the US firm.
""Our experience shows that their track record is not very convincing and I think one should take these kind of promises not only with a pinch of salt but a sack full of salt,"" he said.
""They are giving short-term commitments, but in the long term I think they are heavily orientated toward profitability, and not profitability through new research but profitability from cost cutting.""
Mr Borg added: ""I'm more worried that the Pfizer bid for AstraZeneca is much more driven by tax concerns.
""And we know when you see mergers and acquisitions you see a lot of failures and those that have been driven by tax logic, rather than business logic, tend to be even worse.""
""So I think the proof here is really on Pfizer they must really show that this is really good for Swedish and British society.
""Society is investing heavily in life sciences. Therefore I think there is an obligation on Pfizer to show that they are ready to develop this,"" Mr Borg said.
Pfizer offered Â£63bn for the UK pharmaceutical giant on Friday.
If the deal were to go ahead, it would be the biggest takeover in UK corporate history.
The offer - the second Pfizer has made for AstraZeneca - was immediately rejected by the board of the UK pharmaceutical firm, which said Pfizer continued to ""significantly undervalue"" the company.
MPs are preparing to investigate the proposed takeover deal.
Two parliamentary select committees - the Business Select Committee and the Science and Technology committee - have said they intend to summon the bosses of both companies to answer questions.

932,"But in doing so made it clear Tay's views were a result of nurture, not nature. Tay confirmed what we already knew: people on the internet can be cruel.
Tay, aimed at 18-24-year-olds on social media, was targeted by a ""coordinated attack by a subset of people"" after being launched earlier this week.
Within 24 hours Tay had been deactivated so the team could make ""adjustments"".
But on Friday, Microsoft's head of research said the company was ""deeply sorry for the unintended offensive and hurtful tweets"" and has taken Tay off Twitter for the foreseeable future.
Peter Lee added: ""Tay is now offline and we'll look to bring Tay back only when we are confident we can better anticipate malicious intent that conflicts with our principles and values.""
Tay was designed to learn from interactions it had with real people in Twitter. Seizing an opportunity, some users decided to feed it racist, offensive information.
In China, people reacted differently - a similar chatbot had been rolled out to Chinese users, but with slightly better results.
""Tay was not the first artificial intelligence application we released into the online social world,"" Microsoft's head of research wrote.
""In China, our XiaoIce chatbot is being used by some 40 million people, delighting with its stories and conversations.
""The great experience with XiaoIce led us to wonder: Would an AI like this be just as captivating in a radically different cultural environment?""
The feedback, it appears, is that western audiences react very differently when presented with a chatbot it can influence. Much like teaching a Furby to swear, the temptation to corrupt the well-meaning Tay was too great for some.
That said, Mr Lee said a specific vulnerability meant Tay was able to turn nasty.
""Although we had prepared for many types of abuses of the system, we had made a critical oversight for this specific attack.
""As a result, Tay tweeted wildly inappropriate and reprehensible words and images. We take full responsibility for not seeing this possibility ahead of time.""
He didn't elaborate on the precise nature of the vulnerability.
Mr Lee said his team will continue working on AI bots in the hope they can interact without negative side effects.
""We must enter each one with great caution and ultimately learn and improve, step by step, and to do this without offending people in the process.
""We will remain steadfast in our efforts to learn from this and other experiences as we work toward contributing to an Internet that represents the best, not the worst, of humanity.""

The UK made 158,641 cars last month, 10.4% more than in June 2015.
The SMMT says the growth was driven by decisions to invest on the basis of demand from its biggest market, the EU.
""These decisions were based on many factors but, primarily, on tariff-free access to the single market, economic stability and record levels of productivity from a highly skilled workforce,"" said Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive.
There are signs from elsewhere that the auto sector in the UK is already being affected by the UK's vote to leave the EU.
Car dealer Inchcape has warned that the Brexit vote is expected to slow growth in UK new car registrations in the coming months.

Chief Constable Mark Rowley said he could not comment while the Met Police phone-hacking investigation continues.
He said he did not want to undermine the investigation.
On Wednesday, Milly's parents Bob and Sally, along with her sister Gemma, met Prime Minister David Cameron in Downing Street over the phone hacking claims.
They have also had meetings with Labour leader Ed Miliband and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg.

936,"The US president's phone call contrasts with European concern that the result - 51.4% in favour of the changes - has exposed deep splits in Turkish society.
Mr Erdogan has rejected criticism from international monitors who said he had been favoured by an ""unequal campaign"".
The main opposition party is launching an appeal to invalidate the result.
The changes - due to be introduced before presidential and parliamentary elections in November 2019 - will turn Turkey into a presidential republic similar to the US and France. This could enable President Erdogan to stay in power until 2029.
His narrow victory was ruled valid by Turkey's electoral body, despite claims of irregularities by the opposition.
On Monday, Turkey extended the state of emergency for three months. The measure, introduced after a failed coup last July, was set to expire in two days.
The call from Donald Trump was pre-arranged and the focus was Syria - but the congratulations for President Erdogan's victory means the US president joins leaders from Qatar, Guinea, Djibouti and the Palestinian militant movement Hamas to voice the opinion, while those in Europe have been far more cautious.
It will delight Erdogan supporters, who will see it as legitimising the president's victory. But it will dismay opponents, after Mr Erdogan's fiery tirades against the West and the damning verdict of international observers.
It also exposes a split between the EU and US on Turkey: Mr Trump opting for realpolitik while Europe urges the unpredictable Turkish leader to reconcile a divided country.
And it will reiterate similarities between Presidents Trump and Erdogan on issues like democratic norms and press freedom - though the Turkish president has of course dealt with them in a far more extreme way.
Ultimately, President Trump was perhaps aiming to win favour in Ankara, given that the two sides have fundamental disagreements over Syria.
Syria is one of the issues straining relations between Washington and Ankara.
Turkey is irked by the policy started by the Obama administration of supporting Kurdish fighters in Syria who are fighting so-called Islamic State.
Turkey views the Syrian Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) as a terror group linked to Kurdish separatists waging an insurgency inside Turkey since 1984.
Turkey - a key Nato ally - has established closer co-operation with Russia recently.
The two sides are also at loggerheads over Fethullah Gulen. Turkey accuses the Pennsylvania-based cleric of orchestrating the failed coup and wants him extradited.
Officially Washington insists any decision on returning him to Turkey from the US remains a judicial rather than a political one.
Mr Trump's comments contrasted with a statement by the US state department which mentioned concerns by international observers and urged Turkey to respect the rights of its citizens - chiming with sentiment in European capitals.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned that the ""tight referendum result shows how deeply divided Turkish society is and that means a big responsibility for the Turkish leadership and for President Erdogan personally"".
The European Commission issued a similar call.
Others expressed concern about the possibility of the return of capital punishment.
The French president's office warned that any referendum on reviving the death penalty would ""obviously be a break with values and engagements"" that Turkey had accepted in joining the Council of Europe. The president of the European Parliament, Antonio Tajani, tweeted his own concerns.
Austrian Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz went further. He said the referendum result was a ""clear signal against the European Union"". The ""fiction"" of Turkey's bid to join the bloc must be ended, Mr Kurz said.
Despite saying that the voting day was ""well administered"", the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and the Council of Europe criticised the referendum campaign, and the Council of Europe said the vote ""did not live up"" its standards.
The monitors also criticised a late change by electoral officials that allowed voting papers without official stamps to be counted. But the head of Turkey's electoral body, Sadi Guven, said the unstamped ballot papers had been produced by the High Electoral Board and were valid. He said a similar procedure had been used in past elections.
But the Turkish Bar Association described the move as ""illegal"".
And Austrian MP Alev Korun - one of the Council of Europe observers - said ""there is a suspicion that up to 2.5 million votes could have been manipulated"" - which would have changed the result. She offered no evidence.
Mr Erdogan told supporters that Turkey did not ""see, hear or acknowledge the politically motivated reports"" of the monitors.
The result, he said, ended the debate on changing the constitution and creating an executive presidency, adding that the process of implementing the reforms would now begin.

937,"Writer and illustrator Dick Bruna died peacefully in his sleep on Thursday night in the Dutch city of Utrecht.
He created the much loved character in 1955 as a story to entertain his young son. More than 80 million Miffy books have been sold globally.
Over the years, Bruna wrote more than 100 books but Miffy was by far his most popular and enduring character.
At first, he was uncertain whether the rabbit was a boy or a girl, but settled the matter by putting her in a dress for the sixth book, Miffy's Birthday, in 1970.
Dick Bruna was all about doing more with less. Economy of line was the key behind the much loved Miffy character.
Through only a few simple shapes, heavy graphic lines and primary colours, Bruna was able to capture and convey a huge amount of personality and character.
Miffy delights adults and children alike and we hope that her innocent and loving personality will continue to resonate - she is such a great example of the universal language of illustration.
In the Netherlands, she is called Nijntje (""little rabbit"" as a Dutch toddler might say it). It was her first English translator, Olive Jones, who christened her Miffy.
Bruna was still writing Miffy stories in his old age and his books have been translated into more than 50 languages.
The museum dedicated to her name in Utrecht has tweeted a picture of the white rabbit, arms behind her back, a single tear below her left eye.
Dutch publisher Marja Kerkhof told the AP news agency that he used ""very clear pictures, almost like a pictogram"".
She said his illustrations were often best characterised by what he left out, allowing him ""to go to the essence of things"" while simultaneously using ""very strong powerful primary colours"".
""Even today if you see it in a store you would think, 'hey this looks different to a lot of other things out there',"" she said. ""There is no clutter, it's all very clear.""","The Dutch creator of Miffy the cartoon rabbit has died aged 89, his publishers have announced.",39007462

The deal will boost Ferrovial's accounts. It cuts the Spanish owner's stake in BAA to 49.99%, meaning it no longer has to include the UK firm's debts on its balance sheet.
The deal puts a much higher value on BAA than analysts had expected.
""This sale is in line with our strategy to establish a market valuation of our assets,"" said Ferrovial chief executive Inigo Meiras.
The transaction values BAA - which operates Heathrow, Stansted, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Southampton airports - at Â£4.8bn.
That was more than double consensus, according to news agency Reuters, and news of the sale sent Ferrovial's share price more than 5% higher in morning trading.
However, it is still considerably lower than the Â£10.3bn valuation at which Ferrovial originally bought BAA in 2006.
BAA's value had been damaged by a decision by the UK's Competition Commission that BAA's dominance of air traffic into and out of Scotland and London was unacceptable.
This had already forced BAA's sale of Gatwick Airport, with Stansted and one of Edinburgh and Glasgow set to follow.
By reducing its ownership of BAA to a fraction below 50%, Ferrovial also no longer needs to consolidate its UK subsidiary into its accounts - meaning that it no longer has to include BAA's debts as part of its own.
The accounting rule means that Ferrovial's reported debts will fall by almost three-quarters, from 19.75bn to 5.2bn euros.
However, Ferrovial's remaining stake still leaves it as by far the biggest single investor in BAA, with effective control over the firm.

There's little doubt this year will be the most lucrative on record in terms of grosses and ticket sales. The question now is whether 2016 has enough in its locker to match it.
The answer? Probably not - though there are still more than enough so-called ""tentpole"" releases to keep exhibitors, distributors and cinema chains comfortably out of the poorhouse.
In terms of box-office behemoths, it's hard to look beyond 25 March and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, the eagerly anticipated, long-delayed face-off between the Caped Crusader and the Man of Steel.
With Wonder Woman and Lex Luthor also along for the ride, Zack Snyder's film is a powerful statement of intent from DC Comics, who also have Suicide Squad - a vehicle for its potent stable of comic-book villains - lined up for a 5 August release.
Marvel Entertainment, DC's fiercest rival, will be hoping its lucky streak continues with Captain America: Civil War (29 April), especially with the new Spider-Man - teenaged Brit Tom Holland - joining the ranks of the all-conquering Avengers.
They will also be hoping the same audiences who flocked to see Robert Downey Jr's Iron Man will be just as happy to watch Benedict Cumberbatch cast spells in Doctor Strange (28 November) in the Sherlock star's new guise as the so-called ""Sorcerer Supreme"".

Warner Bros are so confident of the spin-off's success that it has already green-lit two sequels, set for release in 2018 and 2020 respectively.
Star Wars will have a spin-off of its own in December with the release of Rogue One, a prequel of sorts that will dramatise events briefly referred to in the 1977 film that started the franchise.
For those who prefer their sequels a little less brain-taxing, the year will also see returns for Ben Stiller's Derek Zoolander (19 February), Renee Zellweger's Bridget Jones (16 September), Matt Damon's Jason Bourne (29 July), and the crew of the Starship Enterprise in Star Trek Beyond (22 July).
Sequels, it appears, come in all shapes and sizes, be they pugilistic (Rocky continuation Creed, 15 January), dystopian (The Divergent Series: Allegiant, 11 March), phantasmagorical (Alice Through the Looking Glass, 27 May) or belated (Independence Day: Resurgence, 24 June).
The world of animation, meanwhile, has sequels of its own in the form of Kung Fu Panda 3 (11 March), Ice Age: Collision Course (15 July) and Pixar's Finding Dory (29 July).

But - just as in the World Cup final, when they froze at the Melbourne Cricket Ground - they appeared to be undone by a change of location, as they failed to adapt from the low-scoring conditions in which they had played their previous games to Delhi's more batsman-friendly track.
The Black Caps had defended scores of 126, 142 and 145 earlier in the tournament, but England had broken the back of the chase in amassing 49-0 by the time Williamson turned to his leading wicket-taker Mitchell Santner after four overs.
New Zealand's defeat means that they miss out on a first World Twenty20 final, and ensures that the record of no side ever having won the tournament undefeated will continue.
England captain Eoin Morgan: ""I don't think it could have been much better. Maybe we would have liked to start better with the ball, but we did well to peg it back.
""Making a final is the kind of thing you dream of as a kid. Everyone in the dressing room has worked tremendously hard and made a lot of sacrifices to put us in this position.
""A lot of things have gone our way and we have earned the right to play the way we do and we hope it can be our day in the final.""
England batsman Jason Roy: ""There is no better feeling. The joy on everyone's faces was special and something that will stay very close to my heart for rest of my career.
""Again, Jordan and Stokes were outstanding. They practice their skills more than I have ever seen someone practice, so it is so good to see them reaping their rewards on the pitch. We're in the final, and we will take on whoever.""
New Zealand captain Kane Williamson: ""Credit to the England bowlers for the way they pulled it back.
""I knew we were a bit short in our total but we were beaten by the better team, who bowled better than us and came out and batted very aggressively. We weren't able to stem their runs and it was a fantastic knock from Jason Roy.""",England powered into their second World Twenty20 final as they hammered New Zealand by seven wickets in Delhi.,35927712
948,"As teams of officers prepare for a street festival in Brixton, the south London suburb that is one of the hearts of black Britain, a commanding officer says the last image he wants to see that day is a cop in a confrontation with a black youth.
As the camera pans around the briefing room, there is a sea of white faces.
Given that London's population is incredibly diverse and drawn from all continents, the pictures on the television screen don't sit too well with the idea that the police are supposed to represent the society they are policing.
The five-part series The Met has been some 18 months in the making.
Four BBC teams were given open access to the force's units, other than counter-terrorism for security reasons and royal and diplomatic protection on privacy grounds.
One of the most important characters in episode one is Ch Supt Victor Olisa, the borough commander for Haringey.
As an inquest jury decides that armed police lawfully shot dead Mark Duggan in 2011 - a death that triggered that year's riots - you can see his face drop as the dead man's family warn there will be no peace.
When he leaves the police station to talk to a growing and angry crowd, he is accused of being a stooge - a black man put in charge of a difficult problem just to stop black people complaining. In the video above you can see him being challenged by a journalist who questions whether he has the trust of Tottenham.
Ch Supt Olisa says the organisation is at a crossroads - and this first episode of The Met tries to capture that tension: will the Met be able to transform itself into an organisation that commands the trust of all Londoners, rather than just some?
For decades, the Met was the career of choice for the capital's traditional white working-class communities.
But those types of officers in those numbers are representative of a city that has gone. While almost nine out of 10 of the force's officers are white - more than a third of the capital isn't. People born abroad (a different measure of ethnicity to skin colour) are in the majority in at least four of the capital's boroughs. Only 6% of the Met's senior officers, ranked inspector or above, are from a minority background.
As Northern Ireland knows to its cost, when a police force isn't drawn from all of the community it is empowered to police, sometimes with the use of force, trust is hard to come by.
The relationship between the Met and minorities in London reached rock bottom in 1999 when the damning Macpherson Inquiry into the murder of Stephen Lawrence branded the force institutionally racist.
Speaking at the launch of the BBC's series, the Met's commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, said that if people thought that the force was still institutionally racist, then he had to take that on the chin.
But while he says he is trying to change the culture of the force, he knows that he also has to change its face.
Scotland Yard has outsourced some of the stages of recruitment to ensure senior officers don't keep recruiting people who look the same as them. It has offered interest-free loans to help poorer applicants to complete a special pre-entry policing exam and, critically, introduced a London residency test.
Applications from minorities have gone up - not least thanks to a huge PR drive - and as these recruits enter the lower ranks, and older white officers retire, the force will move closer to representing what London looks like today.
But Sir Bernard says the Met cannot transform itself as quickly as London is continuing to change.
As the force's budget falls with forthcoming public spending cuts, the number of new officers the commissioner can recruit will correspondingly fall.
In short, argues the commissioner, the Met needs exceptional help. He wants legislation for a one-off time-limited recruitment exercise that will force rapid change.
Such laws have had a dramatic effect on both the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the New York Police Department.
The system that Sir Bernard wants for London is simple. If an applicant passes the entry exams, they go into a recruitment pool. When there are the widest possible spectrum of candidates available in the pool, they all join the force at the same time.
In other words, there would be no exclusion of white applicants, simply a mechanism to ensure a better balance of new constables as posts become available.
The commissioner's proposals are backed by the London Assembly - but it's ultimately for the home secretary and Parliament to decide whether he gets what he wants.

950,"Openers Lauren Winfield and Tammy Beaumont put on 108 in 75 balls but four wickets in the final four overs pegged England back to 170-5.
Pakistan never looked like chasing down that total, however, and England were helped by a strong fielding display.
Debutant Alex Hartley picked up two wickets as England secured a 57-run victory.
The result means Pakistan have not won a game on this tour in a strong start for Heather Knight as captain, who has seen her young England team play with confidence.
Winfield and Beaumont continued their fine form, as their first-wicket stand took their partnership total for the six-match series to 791 runs.
The pair played aggressively with Winfield taking the lead, making a half-century from 33 balls and striking a towering straight six before being stumped by Sidra Nawaz.
Pakistan came back into the game at the end, with Saida Yousaf taking a stunning overhead catch to dismiss Knight on the boundary as England's middle order stumbled through their final overs.
However, it was always going to be tough for a Pakistan side that has struggled with the bat throughout the tour and England's fielding put them under pressure from the start.
Natasha Farrant took an easy return catch to dismiss Nahia Khan and, despite the odd loose delivery, England's quick fielding - so improved from the Ashes series last year - kept Pakistan in check.

951,"The German government has not confirmed the new estimate, which comes from an internal official report cited by popular daily Bild.
The report warns that services helping refugees will not be able to cope.
Separately, a centre-right regional minister put the expected total at 1.2-1.5 million for this year.
The German government previously estimated the number of asylum claims this year to reach 800,000 to one million in total.
Many are refugees fleeing the wars in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, but there are also many economic migrants from the Balkans, Asia and Africa.
UN High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres has warned that Europe, in dealing with the migration crisis, is engaged in a ""battle of compassion versus fear, and of tolerance versus xenophobia"".
Speaking in Geneva, he said the world was facing the highest levels of forced displacement in recorded history and the principle of asylum must remain sacrosanct.
He urged Europe to defend ""its founding values of tolerance and openness by welcoming refugees of all religions"".
The leaders of Hungary and Slovakia have said the influx of Muslims is a challenge to Europe's ""Christian"" identity.
The Turkish President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, is to meet EU leaders in Brussels shortly to discuss the Syria crisis, which has fuelled an exodus of Syrians to the EU via Turkey.
Greek islands near the Turkish coast are overburdened with migrants, many of them Syrians determined to reach Germany. The crisis has strained EU relations with Turkey, a mainly Muslim country.
Can Turkey help solve EU migrant crisis?
On Sunday several thousand Germans opposed to mass immigration demonstrated in two eastern towns - Plauen and Sebnitz - after a call to action by the anti-Islamic Pegida movement.
Pegida (Patriotic Europeans Against Islamisation of the West) has staged regular anti-immigration marches across Germany.
The migrant influx is stretching resources in many German cities,  including Hamburg, where empty commercial properties can now be seized in order to house migrants.
There is growing political pressure on German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who continues to defend her open-door refugee policy. Germany can manage, the chancellor insisted at the weekend.
But many politicians - including her conservative Bavarian CSU allies and various EU partners - have criticised the policy.
The Interior Minister of Mecklenburg-West Pomerania region, Lorenz Caffier, gave an estimate of 1.2-1.5 million asylum claims for this year.
But federal Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said it was very hard to give accurate figures. Some refugees either avoided registration or moved elsewhere after being registered in one place, he said.
In 2014 the national total for asylum claims was 202,000.
A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.","The number of people seeking asylum in Germany this year will be as high as 1.5 million - almost double the previous estimate, German media report.",34442121

Mr Valls condemned the ""unacceptable violence"" and demanded ""extreme firmness"" in dealing with rioters.
No-one was hurt in the violence but the disruption halted local train services.
The railway line at Moirans between Grenoble and Lyon was cut and a main road in the Isere area was also blocked by burning cars.
The prime minister said those involved would be pursued relentlessly.
The funeral went ahead on Wednesday afternoon, reports said, days after the young man was killed in a crash involving a stolen car. Two other people died in the accident.
Adele Vinterstein, whose son died in the crash told news channel iTele she simply wanted her other son to be at his brother's funeral.
But repeated legal attempts to enable him to leave prison temporarily were turned down, with or without an escort.
""I just don't understand why they won't let him out. He's not a paedophile, he's not a thief, he's not a killer. My son's not a dog,"" Ms Vinterstein told reporters. ""It was his right to say goodbye to his brother and give him a final kiss.""
She appealed for an end to the violence, saying that burning cars did not help.

The Queen said the assembly had a ""well deserved reputation for diligence and competence"".
Presiding Officer Rosemary Butler and First Minister Carwyn Jones welcomed her to the Senedd.
Addressing assembly members in the Senedd, the Queen, said the assembly was there to represent Wales and its people, make the laws for Wales and hold the government of Wales to account.
She said the assembly had ""coped admirably"" with the growth in its powers since devolution, and had a ""well deserved reputation for diligence and competence.""
The opening of the fourth assembly ""marks a significant development in the future of devolution in Wales"".
The Queen said the ""vital functions of democracy"" now rested on the shoulders of the assembly members and much would be expected of them.
She added: ""You are now entrusted with the authority to make laws in all matters contained within the 20 subjects devolved to the assembly and, for the first time, you will be passing assembly acts.
""The performance of the assembly in discharging these new responsibilities will be closely scrutinised here in Wales and elsewhere.""
Carwyn Jones called it an ""important new beginning"" and said it was a great honour to be first minister and serve the people of Wales.
He said: ""There are challenges ahead, and difficult decisions between competing choices will have to be made, but this is fundamentally a time of optimism for Wales.  We have the powers to make a difference.""

The Queen went on to have a lunch of Welsh lamb at the nearby Wales Millennium Centre.
By Betsan PowysBBC Wales' political editor
We've seen The Queen today opening what is, in all but name, a proper Welsh parliament.
In the past, she's opened an assembly with limited law-making powers.
Now, they've been given the tools, as they said, to do the job.
The Queen is, therefore, opening an institution that can get on and forge its own path through these laws that it will start to pass.
There was no reference to Westminster, the responsibility lies here.
We can also look forward to much more drama, potentially, when it comes to that law-making process, thanks to the knife-edge election result in May.
Labour will have to haggle and compromise to get its policies into law much more than in the days of the huge majority afforded to it as a result of the coalition with Plaid Cymru.
It's going to be a very interesting five years of the fourth assembly - the key for both ministers and the assembly itself is what difference Wales will see when it's over.
A fly-past of four Hawks from 208(R) Squadron RAF Valley on Anglesey in Gwynedd took place.
Fanfares at the Senedd were performed by brass and percussion students from the Royal College of Music and Drama.
After the royal opening, the Queen and other royal visitors met guests in the assembly's Neuadd (public space).

Plaid Cymru leader Ieuan Wyn Jones did not attend the Royal opening. A party spokesman said he was still on half-term leave and would not return to work until next week.
The party's AM Jocelyn Davies replaced him in the line-up of party leaders greeting the Queen.
But his absence was criticised by Labour as ""completely disrespectful"" and ""extremely disappointing"" by the Conservatives.
Four Plaid Cymru AMs had already signalled they would not be attending: Leanne Wood, Bethan Jenkins and Lindsay Whittle and Llyr Huws Gruffydd.
Plaid's new North Wales regional AM Mr Gruffydd went to homeless charity Shelter Cymru, and Ms Wood and Mr Whittle were attending a Cardiff Bay Republican Day event.
Ms Wood said it was the third time she would not attend a royal opening of the assembly.
""My wish is for Wales to become a modern, independent country, and I cannot see any place for an outdated concept like the monarchy within it.""
Ms Jenkins said she would spend the day talking to businesses in Bridgend about the economic downturn.
""I define myself as a republican so I don't believe the royal family represent what I believe in as a Welsh citizen,"" she said.
""I respect the people who are attending but I decided to carry on my work as an assembly member and try to represent the people of my area to the best of my abilities.""
But their Plaid Cymru colleague and former presiding officer Lord Elis-Thomas said it was right that The Queen should take part in an historic day, opening an assembly which now has direct law-making powers.
He said it was a recognising the ""new democracy of Wales"", an occasion as significant as the state opening of parliament at Westminster.
""It's our day - a day for celebrating Wales within the UK constitution,"" he said.
""We live within a parliamentary constitution which has a monarchical structure - if people want to have a debate about whether there should be a republic and we had a referendum, there's no question about which way I would vote.""
The Senedd's new Presiding Officer, Rosemary Butler, AM, told BBC Radio Wales afterwards that she faced a ""very interesting task"" in steering the members forward to make sure its new powers were used ""for the people of Wales"".
She added that the debating style of the AMs in Cardiff was different to MPs in Westminster.
She said she was confident that all the political parties would work together and if there is ""confrontation"" then she will ""have to be more strict"".
There was also room to ""communicate better"" with the people of Wales about the Senedd's work, she added.
The reception at the Wales Millennium Centre was used to showcase new and established Welsh talent, including choir Only Men Aloud.
Personnel from No. 4 School of Technical Training, based at MoD St Athan, Vale of Glamorgan, took part in parade duties with members of the Air Training Corps from around Wales.

The queen opened the assembly with Labour in government but without an outright majority.
The party won 30 of the 60 seats in May's elections.
The assembly has developed ceremonial elements of previous royal openings by engaging the Wales Herald, the Honourable Thomas Lloyd, and enhancing the role of the Macebearer, David Melding AM.

954,"The Court of Appeal rejected a challenge on whether officers could confer before a court case involving a fatality at the hands of police.
Mr Duggan was shot by police in north London in August 2011 in Tottenham.
The 29-year-old's death sparked riots in the area, which then spread to other cities in England.
The case was brought by his mother Pamela Duggan and relatives of Rafal Delezuch, who died after being restrained by Leicestershire Police officers in 2012.
Duggan family lawyers argued the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) was operating a policy of allowing officers to confer which was inconsistent with the stance of the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).
Lord Justice Moore-Bick, Lord Justice Richards and Lord Justice Tomlinson said the IPCC had decided that key officers involved in a death should normally be separated from one another and not allowed to confer.
The three judges said ""the risk of collusion"" after an incident involving police ""cannot be avoided altogether"", but new guidance, issued by ACPO this year, went ""a long way"" towards reducing the risk, but they added that the document was ""imperfect"" lacking clarity and precision.
They said they were particularly concerned about two aspects of the guidance: allowing officers to remain together at the scene of an incident and as they travelled back to a police station, and the ""unsupervised interval"" between writing their initial accounts of what had happened and a detailed version up to 48 hours later.
""The less that is said... the greater is the scope for contamination of the detailed account by reason of intervening collusion,"" they said.
Lord Justice Richards added: ""The IPCC has asserted its independence in issuing draft guidance that differs materially from the 2014 guidance.
""If it proceeds to issue statutory guidance, whether in that or in revised form, chief officers will have to take due account of it and consideration will no doubt have to be given to whether the 2014 guidance should be brought into line with it.""
That was ""for the future"", said the judge.
The judges dismissed the appeals and refused permission to take the case to the Supreme Court.

The students were marching from their campus in the capital, Port Moresby, towards parliament where Mr O'Neill faces a possible no confidence motion.
They are demanding that he stand down and answer corruption allegations. Mr O'Neill has denied wrongdoing.
In a statement later on Wednesday, Mr O'Neill said ""a small group of students were violent, threw rocks at police and provoked a response that came in the form of tear gas and warning shots"".
""The factors that led to students being injured are yet to be ascertained,"" he said, condemning ""agitators responsible for instigating a violent confrontation"".
The government said an inquiry would be launched to determine what caused the clashes.
In a separate development, parliament was adjourned on Wednesday until August.
Footage obtained by the BBC appeared to show a large crowd of students at the campus running away as shots and tear gas were fired.
Political tension in the country has been rising for weeks, with thousands of students at the University of Papua New Guinea boycotting classes demanding the resignation of PM O'Neill. Classes were officially suspended last month.
In May, Mr O'Neill responded to a petition from students saying that he would not be resigning. He said the corruption allegations against him were of ""questionable political intent"", as reported by ABC.
Papua New Guinea was ranked one of the most corrupt countries in the world in 2012 by Transparency International.
In 2014, Mr O'Neill himself was accused of fraud by the national anti-corruption watchdog, which issued a warrant for his arrest. The warrant has not been carried out so far.
According to the World Bank, 70% of the country, the most linguistically diverse in the world, lives in poverty.
Medical officials in Port Moresby told Reuters that at least 10 students had been admitted ""in a difficult situation"".
Images circulating on social media also showed injured students being carried away.
There have been conflicting reports of casualties. Opposition figures told parliament that four people had died, while other reports said one person was dead.
Reuters quoted an unnamed aid agency as saying it had heard reports four students died at a clinic on the campus in the Waigani suburb of Port Moresby.
The main hospital in the capital told local news site EMTV that it had seen no fatalities.
Papua New Guinea Police Commissioner Gari Baki said no deaths had been reported, according to the Associated Press news agency.
One eyewitness, David Rupa, told the BBC he was on his way to work when he became caught in the protest at about 08:50 local time (23:50 GMT Tuesday).
He said he could see tear gas and people running for cover and heard shots fired.
""I saw policemen hit and kick girls who couldn't run [fast enough] and were bashed up. I cried and was told I will be shot if I was going to take photos or video.""
He also said he had seen smoke coming from a dormitory at the university, and that parents were coming down to the campus to make sure their children were not hurt.
Gary Juffa, an MP and vocal critic of the prime minister, said on Twitter he had been told the shooting began with an argument between one student and a police superintendent.

Hammond, he said, had wished him good luck and gave assurances he ""didn't blame him"" for taking the job.
Evans also said there will ""absolutely"" be a woman in the new Top Gear line-up.
But he said he would not have a female co-presenter just ""for the sake of it"".
""I want to have people who are extremely knowledgeable about cars... people who have great energy, good timing... who are keen to do things differently,"" he told Radio 5 live.
The BBC has yet to confirm the rest of the Top Gear line-up - but Formula 1 presenter Suzi Perry featured prominently in the audience of Evans' TV show TFI Friday last week.
In his first remarks about the Top Gear job, broadcast on Radio 2 at 08:15 BST, Evans said Clarkson had also wished him ""the best of luck"".
Clarkson ""then gave me a piece of advice which I'm not going to repeat on the radio"", the broadcaster told his listeners.
Clarkson's contract was not renewed by the BBC after he punched a Top Gear producer in March.
Evans, a noted car enthusiast, had previously ruled himself out of becoming taking over the show.
Evans said he had wanted Top Gear to carry on with Hammond and May and had not wanted to ""contaminate the situation"" by throwing his hat in the ring.
""Whenever I said 'I categorically rule myself out of running for office', it was because I didn't want to be a pawn in a chess game involving three of my friends.""
The situation changed this week, he explained, with Hammond and May confirming they would not continue on the programme in Clarkson's absence.
This led to a conversation with Mark Linsey, the BBC's controller of entertainment commissioning, and an offer he felt he had to accept.
Top Gear, said Evans, was ""the biggest television show in the world"" and his ""favourite television show of all time"".
""I love producing TV... and so I said yes,"" continued the former TFI Friday host, who will lead an as yet unconfirmed line-up of new presenters.
Hammond, Evans went on, had told him he was ""designed and built"" for the Top Gear job and that his hiring was ""always the BBC's very best option"".
Evans also hinted obliquely that James May may play some role on the programme in future.
""We're going to meet up today and tomorrow and talk about things and who knows what might happen there.""
Evans has signed a three-year deal to host and produce the BBC Two show, one of the corporation's most popular international exports.
It is watched by 350 million viewers worldwide, with overseas sales worth an estimated Â£50m a year.
Evans has also received the backing of Chris Goffey, who co-hosted Top Gear in the 1980s and 1990s.
The broadcaster, Goffey told BBC Breakfast, was ""the obvious choice"", asking: ""Who else in TV is really clued-up about the cars and has got a persona to match Jeremy's?""
Speaking to Radio 5 live on Wednesday, Evans said he had started formulating ideas for the show on Saturday, adding they involved ""evolution, not revolution"".
""The films have got to stay there,"" he said of the elaborate film sequences that were a feature of the Clarkson era. ""They're a crucial part of what Top Gear is.
""We'll look at what we have to put in, what we need to put in, and then we'll see what we might want to put in,"" he continued.
""The first thing I'm going to do is sit down [with the Top Gear production team] and say, 'tell me what you know.'""
In addition to confirming ""100 percent"" that a woman would feature on the new presenting line-up, Evans said the popular Star in a Reasonably Priced Car segment would remain a Top Gear staple.
But he said it would change and that ""bells and whistles"" would be added.

962,"The 23-year-old wicketkeeper-batsman thrilled the Lord's crowd with a scintillating 121 from 74 balls.
His innings, and with it England's hopes, ended unceremoniously when he was run out in the final over.
Kumar Sangakkara set Sri Lanka on their way to 300-9 with a fine 112, which included 14 fours.
""England will be kicking themselves. They will feel elated at seeing one of their team-mates play such an innings, but they will be deflated too. Perhaps they need more power at the top; they need to start the chase quicker.""
If Sangakkara's innings proved the most important, Buttler's was the most explosive.
From the depths of 111-5, he smashed the fastest ODI century by an England player, hitting 11 fours and four sixes.
He and Ravi Bopara added 133 in 16.2 thrilling overs to keep pace with a required run-rate of more than nine an over.
Although Bopara fell for 51 with 57 needed off 32 balls, Buttler's explosive strokeplay carried England into the final over needing 12 to win.
However, Chris Jordan holed out at long-on from the second delivery and Buttler was comfortably run out chasing an impossible single off the fourth as the brilliant Lasith Malinga limited England to four runs.
Earlier, left-hander Sangakkara showed why he is considered one of the game's greats with a fluent 19th ODI century as he and fellow veteran Tillakaratne Dilshan (71) put on 172 for the second wicket after England won the toss.
They were aided by England's bowlers, who struggled to find the movement that helped them bowl Sri Lanka out for 67 in the third ODI at Old Trafford on Tuesday.

Left-arm seamer Harry Gurney claimed 4-55 in his fifth ODI, while James Anderson and Jordan shared four expensive wickets.
England's chase began sluggishly as captain Alastair Cook and opening partner Ian Bell fell to Malinga inside the first four overs.
Gary Ballance and Joe Root, who made 42 and 43 respectively, were steady but unspectacular as England struggled to build momentum - between the ninth and 31st overs they failed to score a boundary.
Once Eoin Morgan fell for 12 in the 29th over, it appeared England were heading for a forgettable defeat.
But Lancashire's Buttler, who made his one-day international debut in 2012, and Bopara rescued the hosts with the highest sixth-wicket stand in ODIs at Lord's.
After Buttler smashed Nuwan Kulasekara for two sixes and a four in the 46th over, an improbable victory was in sight with 36 needed from 24 balls.

964,"The solid iron core is actually crystalline, surrounded by liquid.
But the temperature at which that crystal can form had been a subject of long-running debate.
Experiments outlined in Science used X-rays to probe tiny samples of iron at extraordinary pressures to examine how the iron crystals form and melt.
Seismic waves captured after earthquakes around the globe can give a great deal of information as to the thickness and density of layers in the Earth, but they give no indication of temperature.
That has to be worked out either in computer models that simulate the Earth's insides, or in the laboratory.
Measurements in the early 1990s of iron's ""melting curves"" - from which the core's temperature can be deduced - suggested a core temperature of about 5,000C.
""It was just the beginning of these kinds of measurements so they made a first estimate... to constrain the temperature inside the Earth,"" said Agnes Dewaele of the French research agency CEA and a co-author of the new research.
""Other people made other measurements and calculations with computers and nothing was in agreement. It was not good for our field that we didn't agree with each other,"" she told BBC News.
The core temperature is crucial to a number of disciplines that study regions of our planet's interior that will never be accessed directly - guiding our understanding of everything from earthquakes to the Earth's magnetic field.
""We have to give answers to geophysicists, seismologists, geodynamicists - they need some data to feed their computer models,"" Dr Dewaele said.
The team has now revisited those 20-year-old measurements, making use of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility - one of the world's most intense sources of X-rays.
To replicate the enormous pressures at the core boundary - more than a million times the pressure at sea level - they used a device called a diamond anvil cell - essentially a tiny sample held between the points of two precision-machined synthetic diamonds.
Once the team's iron samples were subjected to the high pressures and high temperatures using a laser, the scientists used X-ray beams to carry out ""diffraction"" - bouncing X-rays off the nuclei of the iron atoms and watching how the pattern changed as the iron changed from solid to liquid.
Those diffraction patterns give more insight into partially molten states of iron, which the team believes were what the researchers were measuring in the first experiments.
They suggest a core temperature of about 6,000C, give or take 500C - roughly that of the Sun's surface.
But importantly, Dr Dewaele said, ""now everything agrees"".","New measurements suggest the Earth's inner core is far hotter than prior experiments suggested, putting it at 6,000C - as hot as the Sun's surface.",22297915

His partner Jennie Gray has pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice but denies a charge of child cruelty.
The Old Bailey heard the pair were reluctant to talk to police following the death of their daughter at St George's Hospital in Tooting.
PC Steve Stewart told the court: ""I discovered them both to be hostile and unwilling to speak to police until the previous matter was known where they believed there had been a miscarriage of justice.""
The court heard Mr Butler was convicted of harming Ellie in 2007 when she was six weeks old, but won an appeal and got his daughter back from foster care 11 months before her death.
He said accusations were made after she suffered a bleed on the brain and everything had got ""twisted and turned"", which made him ""nervous"" about talking to authorities.
""I went to court, jail, came out,"" he told the jury. ""They found out it was a medical problem and a miscarriage of justice. I have nothing to hide but that's why I'm nervous.""

971,"They said the next government in 2015 must ""urgently address"" the role and effectiveness of Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures (TPims).
The Joint Committee on Human Rights' report highlighted the risk of someone going missing while under TPims.
The Home Office said the measures were the strongest the courts would allow.
TPims involve restrictions including overnight residence at a specified address, GPS tagging, reporting requirements and restrictions on travel, movement, association, communication, finances, work and study.
By Dominic CascianiHome affairs correspondent, BBC News
By the end of this month six TPim suspects will be free - meaning there is only one man still subject to the monitoring conditions. Given the secrecy around the system, you can never be sure that there isn't another suspect we don't know about.
Control orders - the more restrictive regime that came before TPims - had many opponents who said the house-arrest style conditions were unjust and oppressive.
TPims inherited those critics and attracted more still, including security experts who said the new regime was too lax.
What does seem to be working now is a strategy to intervene earlier by charging suspects with preparing acts of terrorism. This group may include suspects who, at one time, would have been considered for a TPim because of police concerns that they had lots of intelligence but no hard evidence to present to a jury.
The measures were introduced in December 2011 as a replacement for the more restrictive regime of control orders, intended to prevent suspects from engaging in terrorist-related activity.
The report said there were eight TPim notices in force as of November last year, all of which were for British citizens.
But seven of those will have expired by the end of this month, according to the report.
The committee said TPims should be looked at as part of a wider review of counter-terrorism powers.
Its report urged the government ""to engage more transparently and substantively"" with recommendations of the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation.
The report said: ""We are left with the impression that in practice TPims may be withering on the vine as a counter-terrorism tool of practical utility.""
The committee concluded that the measures were not ""investigative"" in any real sense, and suggested they should be known as Terrorism Prevention Orders or something similar.
It said it agreed with the independent reviewer that the very nature of TPims ""carries an inherent risk of the subject absconding"".
And it recommended that more information about an internal review of TPims - launched after two subjects went missing - be made public.
Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed - who has been linked to the Somali militant group al-Shabab - absconded in November after changing into a burka while visiting a west London mosque.
His case followed that of Ibrahim Magag, who went missing in December 2012 in a black cab after ripping off his electronic tag.
Committee chairman Hywel Francis said: ""There is no evidence that they serve any investigative function and even as preventive measures they seem to be going out of favour with the agencies.
""Very few TPims are in operation and almost all of these are due shortly to lapse after their two-year duration.""
Mr Francis said there is too little information known about the individuals on whom these measures have been imposed to make a proper judgement about whether the power to impose them is ""no longer required"".
""The next government will need to look again at these measures within the context of counter-terrorism powers more generally,"" he added.
David Anderson, the independent reviewer of terror legislation, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme TPims were ""a necessary evil"".
""One thing it shows is that police and prosecutors are doing their job,"" he said.
""We've had a lot of convictions over the last couple of years, a lot of guilty pleas and a lot of heavy sentences.""
TPims ""don't present a long-term solution"", he added.
Home Secretary Theresa May said TPims would also help the authorities gather material that would lead to prosecutions.
But the committee said it ""failed to find any evidence"" the measures had led to more suspects being charged.
TPim restrictions have been or are about to be lifted from seven suspects, including men allegedly involved in planning terrorist attacks.
The measures were imposed two years ago and cannot be renewed.
A Home Office spokesman said: ""TPims were introduced because control orders were not working and their powers were being struck down by the courts.
""They now provide some of the strongest possible protections that the courts will allow.""","Restrictions put on terror suspects by the home secretary may be ""withering on the vine"", a group of MPs and peers has warned.",25847438

Relive England's win against Poland
England can now look forward to a semi-final at the Stadion Miejski in Tychy on Tuesday, 27 June [17:00 BST] although they will not know who they will face until the completion of the group stage on Saturday.
They will play either Portugal from Group B or Germany, Italy or the Czech Republic from Group C.
There are only three groups at the tournament - with the three winners each progressing along with the best-placed runners up.  Who England play depends on who claims the spot as the best runner-up.
At the moment Slovakia, who finished second in Group A behind England with six points and a goal difference of +3, are in a strong position to claim it.
If that happens then England will play the winner of Group C, which with one round of games left to play is topped by Germany with six points.
However, if Slovakia do not claim that place then England's last-four opponents will be either Portugal (who are the only team in Group B that could finish in a better position than Slovakia) or Germany, Italy or the Czech Republic (who could all finish in second place with a better record than Slovakia) in Group C.
England's first 135 minutes of football at the tournament did nothing to suggest they were capable of avoiding a third successive group-stage exit.
They were unadventurous and ponderous in the opener against Sweden, managing just a single shot on target, and were equally poor for the first 45 minutes of their second game against Slovakia, in which they trailed 1-0 at the break.
However, they showed grit and determination to fight back and win that game 2-1, putting them in control of their own destiny, and they came out fighting in an intimidating atmosphere against Poland.
Goalkeeper Jordan Pickford once again showed why Everton paid Sunderland £30m for his services with a confident and assured display, while the Leicester pair of Ben Chilwell and Gray were also excellent.
Chilwell dominated down the left, snubbing out Poland attacks while getting forward quickly to create chances, and it was from his excellent pass that Gray scored the opener.
But in truth there were standout performances all over the pitch for England.
Southampton midfielder James Ward-Prowse provided a threat from set-pieces that is so often lacking at senior level, while Alfie Mawson was a dominant presence in defence as well as offering an aerial threat in attack.
The Swansea defender was only denied adding his name to the scoresheet by an excellent Jakub Wrabel save.
After a slow start it appears England are finding their form just at the right time.

It has been a good summer of major tournament football so far for England.
They reached the final of the European Under-17 Championship before losing to Spain on penalties.#
England then claimed their biggest international title since 1966 when their Under-20 side won the World Cup earlier this month, and now the Under-21s are now just two wins away from lifting another major trophy.
However, Spain have been the standout team at the tournament so far. They were the only team to secure their place in the semi-finals with a game to spare and boast some outstanding talent.
Saul Niguez, an Atletico Madrid regular and capped three times by the Spanish senior side, scored a memorable overhead kick in a 5-0 defeat of Macedonia, with Real Madrid's Marco Asensio scoring a hat-trick in that game.
Germany have also won their two games so far and have the tournament's most formidable defence - they are the only team yet to concede a goal.
However, if England perform like they did against Poland then they have every chance of emulating their Under-20 counterparts.
England Under-20 boss Paul Simpson, who was co-commentator on the game for BBC Radio 5 live:
""That was a top, top performance from the first whistle. They did everything manager Aidy Boothroyd would have wanted. It wasn't done by lumping it forwards, it was controlled possession while also being a real threat from set-pieces.
""This performance puts a marker down and shows what we are all about - we are not just here to make up the numbers, we are into the semi-final. And we can go on and get even stronger.""
England Under-21s boss Aidy Boothroyd: ""It's a great moment. After the first game, which was a draw, it was doom and gloom. But we have a good group here and got the two wins that we needed. It was a high-pressure game, if we hadn't won then we would be out.
""We carried out the game plan to a T. We controlled the game and played really well. There were a few nervy moments.
""Demarai Gray was terrific. He worked his socks off. It is a squad game and one of the hardest things is keeping the lads who aren't playing motivated. But it is a good group, I'm really pleased.""

But it was also part of a wider trend, which has seen the ratio fall since mid-2015 as consumer spending outstripped growth in disposable incomes.
John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, said: ""On the surface, today's national accounts data reconfirmed the earlier picture that the UK economy remained relatively robust in the second half of 2016 following the Brexit vote.
""Beneath the surface though, some more worrying signs are evident.""
Among them is that household net borrowing in the fourth quarter rose to over Â£11bn, the highest quarterly level in nearly 30 years, he said.
""This pushed the household savings ratio in [the fourth quarter of] 2016 down to its lowest level since comparable records began in 1963,"" he added.
The Bank of England has predicted that weaker incomes will result in a ""significant fall"" in the saving ratio over the next three years.
The UK's economy last year defied forecasts that it would slow sharply after the vote in June to take the country out of the European Union.
However, inflation has gathered pace in recent months, driven in part by the fall in the value of sterling since the Brexit vote.
With prices rising and wage growth slowing, 2017 was ""likely to be a very tough year for the consumer"", said Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY Item Club.
He added that monthly figures for the services sector indicated that output fell 0.1% in January.
The British economy continued to grow strongly at the end of last year boosted by the dominant services sector and increasing exports.
That meant that growth for the whole year was a respectable 1.8%.
The two key factors were the fall in value of the pound which has helped British exporters to boost exports by 4.6% and by strong consumer spending that has kept the services sector of the economy performing well.
Household spending rose by 0.7% in the last three months of 2016 alone. But there are signs that may not continue for long; inflation is now rising at almost the same rate as wages and that is likely to squeeze spending power, while households have few savings to fall back on.
The savings ratio at 3.3% is already at its lowest level since records began in 1963.

976,"As the Scottish Football Association's performance director Malky Mackay has held a series of presentations to member clubs about the proposal, the reaction has been generally positive, even from outfits that had previously been sceptical or resistant.
There would be few grimaces to the notion of restoring a form of reserve team football, though, when almost everybody involved in Scottish football points to the loss of that level of the game being critical to youth academy graduates not being mentally or physically battle-hardened enough for first-team football.
Consensus is the prize for Mackay, since it will enable him to deliver the project in a viable form that the clubs buy into, and the sense is that the momentum is behind him.
""Ninety-five percent of what has been said, people agree with,"" he said on BBC Radio Scotland's Sportsound.
Mackay has held three presentations this week, with a fourth to follow. He has put detail on to the outlines that were aired when points from a draft copy of Project Brave were published in the media.
The difference between the youth development plan that Mackay has been appointed to oversee and the one that predecessor Mark Wotte established six years ago is that the clubs have been directly involved in producing the blueprint.
Mackay is clear that communication is vital - he has visited 10 clubs since officially starting his role three weeks ago and will make his way around all 42 directly. For Project Brave to succeed, clubs need to buy into it and implement it.
""People have in the main agreed that something radical needs to be done,"" Mackay said. ""And this is radical.""
Media playback is not supported on this device
What the clubs are agreeing with is the establishment of a reserve league and an under-18 league, encouraging more development loans, a summer calendar for academy football (with indoor futsal taking place in the winter) and coach development, with a head of coaching to be appointed to lead the development of the best coaches at each club.
""This whole programme is based on coaches,"" Mackay explained. ""Our coach education programme is second to none. What we're not good at is coach mentoring.
""I'm going to ask the clubs to give me their best young coach and I'll put on a course for them, we'll set them tasks, have them for a year thinking deeply about certain problems, make our good young coaches very good young coaches.
""Clubs want that to happen and we need to for our next Scotland managers. Everybody we've spoken to is up for this. We need to make the [coaches] better to make our players better.
""The part that comes up is money, funding.""
Some clubs were initially wary of the prospect of the academy system being streamlined. The plan is to reduce the number of funded elite academies from 29 to a maximum of 16.
Clubs will need to submit a three-year business plan to show that their academy is financially viable, has enough support staff and coaches and good enough facilities. Academies will also be judged on measurable performance outcomes, including the number of graduates in the first team, the number actively out on loan at other clubs and the number representing the national team.
All of this will be assessed by an independent company and the selected elite academies will receive funding but also play each other in a competitive league to maintain the best v best strategy.
Other clubs will still be able to run academies or community outreach schemes. All will continue to receive their current level of funding for three years after Project Brave is implemented, a commitment that has won a lot of support for the plan.
""There is a soft landing for clubs, there is a lot of support and help going to be given,"" Mackay said.
""We are setting the bar high because it has to be the elite players we're focusing on. It's the 19-21 age group where the whole thing breaks down and we need to get them into first teams.
""It's up to us to educate 11-16-year-olds. We need to be better athletes and have them running properly at that age, proper sports science, diet and nutrition advice, to be under 10% body fat and sports psychology to make sure they are mentally stronger. We need to build better footballers.""
Talent identification will be a key factor, particularly when clubs will have to reduce the number of players in their academy. Mackay will establish a talent identification programme at the SFA to assist clubs in predicting which players will make the grade at 19 by measuring and assessing physical and mental markers as they develop.
""It's imperative for Scottish football,"" he said.
Once Mackay has completed his presentations the next stage of the process is for Project Brave to be presented to the SFA board. Following that, and once the clubs have signed off on it, the plans will begin to be implemented in time for season 2017-18.
""It's about what is the best for the young Scottish elite player,"" Mackay added.
Mackay has begun the process of making the case for Project Brave, and so far he has been encouraged by the reaction. For now, Scottish football seems prepared to embrace change.",Project Brave is designed to be a radical solution for Scottish football and it brings elements of the past to bear on the future.,38765666

Sansum won a world silver medal in May but lost to Muhammad in October.

Ms Southern said stopping people being recruited to terrorist groups online was a ""significant challenge"".
""My workload, as is reflected across the country, has increased five fold - we are holding the biggest case load outside London,"" she said.

981,"He will present an hour-long programme on Radio 2 on Friday evenings, the BBC confirmed.
The broadcaster, who is 73 years old, was taken off air in February.
Director general Tony Hall said at the time Blackburn had failed to fully co-operate with the Jimmy Savile inquiry.
In a statement, Blackburn said: ""I do not seek to criticise the BBC for decisions it has made in the past.
""I have had a difficult year personally, but I'm pleased to be returning to the BBC and can't wait to get behind the mic again.""
A spokesperson for the BBC said: ""The BBC stands by the findings of Dame Janet Smith and the decision it made to take Tony Blackburn off air at the start of this year based on Dame Janet's preference for the documentary evidence relating to meetings that took place over Tony Blackburn's statements.""
Who is Tony Blackburn?
The son of a doctor from Guildford, Tony Blackburn was the first DJ to broadcast on Radio 1 when it launched in September 1967. He spent 17 years at the station and also presented Top of the Pops and was a weekly fixture on Noel's House Party. Prior to all that, he had broadcast on Radio Caroline South and then Radio London.
After Radio 1, he was one of the launch presenters on Capital Gold. He has also hosted Radio 2's Pick Of The Pops as well as regular bank holiday specials for the stations. He has also had shows on BBC London 94.9, BBC Radio Berkshire, the Magic network, BBC3CR and KMFM.
In 2002 he won the ITV reality TV programme I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!
Blackburn's new Radio 2 programme will replace the show currently hosted Desmond Carrington, who announced last month he was retiring after 70 years in broadcasting.
Dame Janet Smith's inquiry had rejected the evidence from the Radio 2 DJ.
Blackburn, who had threatened to sue the BBC, said the report included an accusation he was among celebrities who ""seduced"" a 15-year-old girl.
In a statement, he denied the allegation and said he was cleared of wrongdoing.
He accused the BBC of making him a ""scapegoat"" for its own ""cover-up"" of abuse.
After the news of his return to Radio 2 was confirmed on Wednesday morning, Blackburn tweeted: ""Thank you for all your lovely messages.""

982,"It is the first hairdryer powered by a miniaturised air pump in the handle, using the same airflow principles as Dyson's desk fan products.
The company said it had invested £50m in the development of the device.
However, the £299 price tag makes it at least twice as expensive as salon-grade dryers made by rival manufacturers.
""People do spend a lot of money to take care of their hair,"" said Thidathip Tawichai, analyst at Euromonitor International.
""People in developed markets usually look after their personal care more and buy more expensive products.
""But £300 is very expensive and a lot to invest in a hairdryer. People like to follow fashions and spend a little money trying different things,"" she told the BBC.
Dyson is best known for its bagless vacuum cleaners and high-speed hand dryers, although it says it has a further 40 products in development.
The company's founder Sir James Dyson said developing a hairdryer was an ""obvious"" choice.
""There just happens to be a huge field in airflow,"" he told the BBC.
""We make very high-speed motors... so it's rather obvious that we would carry on and use that in everything involved in airflow.""
The company said it had spent £50m investigating the ""limitations"" of conventional hairdryers. The biggest problem, according to Sir James, was that styling attachments and the dryer's proximity to hair slowed airflow and led to hair being overheated.
""If you overheat the hair, you get water bubbles in the cortex exploding and blasting holes in the fibres, which gives you a dull look and damaged hair,"" he told the BBC.
Defending the price of the hairdryer, which will cost more than some of the firm's latest vacuum cleaners, Sir James said: ""We all spend 20-30 minutes every day doing our hair, so you use it an awful lot.
""Not damaging your hair, that's worth a lot of money.""
Personal care analyst Roshida Khanom of Mintel said women in particular had started looking for products that were kinder to their hair.
""We found a high proportion of women are limiting their use of heat appliances and 20% had bought appliances that claim to be less damaging, so there's definitely a market for products that don't damage hair,"" she told the BBC.
While Dyson's hairdryer will be marketed at consumers as well as haircare professionals, Sir James said it was more important to satisfy customers than to appeal to a wide audience.
""It's not so much how many you sell that's important, it's whether people who buy it like it,"" he told the BBC.
""I don't mind if I only sell 100 a year, as long as those 100 people think it's really good. I wouldn't make much money but that's not always the point. That's not what drives us, that's not what makes it exciting.""

983,"The new Tobacco Control Plan aims to slash smoking rates from 15.5% to 12% of the population by 2022, paving the way to a smoke-free generation.
If national smoking rates continue to fall, this generation of non-smokers could be achieved by 2030, says charity Action on Smoking and Health (Ash).
Health officials say smoking currently kills 200 people a day in England.
Smoking rates in England are at the lowest level since records began.
But the Department of Health says there is still much further to go.
It has sets out a range of targets:
Commenting on the proposals, Deborah Arnott, the chief executive of Ash, said: ""The vision of a smoke-free generation it sets out is a welcome step-change in ambition from the last Tobacco Control Plan for England and should be achievable by 2030.""
But she warned that the success of the plan - which emphasises local over national action -  was threatened by ""severe government cuts in public health funding"".
There is no new money to achieve this plan and no penalties for local areas that fail to meet the targets.
And smoking rates remain stubbornly high in some regions, particularly among the lowest earners.
Public Health England's chief executive Duncan Selbie said the country was at a ""pivotal point"" where the end was in sight and a smoke-free generation a reality.
But he added: ""The final push, reaching the most vulnerable and disadvantaged, will undoubtedly be the hardest.""
Meanwhile, Simon Clark, director of the smokers' group Forest, called on ministers to ""stop lecturing"" people.
He said: ""The most important stakeholder is the consumer, yet they are routinely ignored by the government. Ministers should stop lecturing smokers and engage with them.""
Public health minister, Steve Brine, said: ""Smoking continues to kill hundreds of people a day in England, and we know the harms fall on some of the poorest and most vulnerable people in our society.
""That is why we are targeting prevention and local action to address the variation in smoking rates in our society, educate people about the risks and support them to quit for good.""
One of the areas the government's plan focuses on is cutting smoking rates in pregnancy, partly by calling on local areas to appoint smoke-free pregnancy ""champions"".
It comes as the Smoking in Pregnancy Challenge Group - which includes academic institutions and charities- says pregnant women who find it hard to quit should be encouraged to try e-cigarettes as an alternative.
Prof Linda Bauld, chairwoman of the group, told the BBC: ""Smoking in pregnancy is uniquely harmful. It causes 2,000 premature births, 5,000 miscarriages and 300 deaths of babies every year in the UK.
""So if somebody is struggling to stop, let us be open about that, let us talk about all the options.
""If a woman is really struggling and wants to use e-cigarettes, then from what we know to date in the UK, we shouldn't be preventing those women from using them.""","The government has set out an ambitious plan to make England, in effect, smoke-free in the next few decades.",40641469
984,"The Chiefs had a bonus point inside half an hour as Tom Johnson, Dean Mumm, Matt Jess and Fetu'u Vainikolo scored.
A fifth try for Ben White made it 36-3 at half-time, but the Blues hit back on the resumption to claim a losing bonus point for scoring four of their own.
Lloyd Williams, Robin Copeland, Alex Cuthbert and Harry Robinson all crossed to earn a measure of respectability.
But a penalty from replacement Henry Slade five minutes from time saw Exeter - who were reduced to 13 men after two yellow cards inside a minute early in the final quarter - have the last word.
They will head to Glasgow next weekend in buoyant mood after their best European win to date, while the Blues must regroup swiftly for the visit of defending champions Toulon  after an embarrassingly one-sided first half on Sunday.
In a debut campaign last season that included two narrow losses to three-time champions Leinster and home-and-away wins over the Scarlets, the Chiefs showed a relish to broaden their horizons.
Their early ambition - attacking from deep with ball in hand - almost cost them when Gareth Steenson's pass was intercepted by Cory Allen in the sixth minute, but the Blues centre could not hold onto the ball.
""We didn't see the Blues in that first half. They were found wanting defensively, they couldn't get the ball or keep it. It was as one-sided an encounter as I have ever seen at this level. Exeter knew the game was won in the second half, their foot came off the pedal, they made changes and lost their rhythm. The Blues couldn't have got any worse and did lift their game. There was more pride in the performance and they got four tries by sticking in there.""
Undeterred, the Chiefs launched another multi-phase attack which ended in a try for England international Johnson, one of four capped players in the home line-up compared with the 13 on duty for the Blues.
The flanker was driven over by centre Jason Shoemark from close range and, with next to no possession, the Blues were grateful for Leigh Halfpenny's long-range penalty to make it 5-3.
It proved a momentary aberration though as the one-way traffic continued for the rest of the half.
With fly-half Steenson controlling matters and full-back Phil Dollman a constant threat with his incisive running and support work, Exeter were in total command.
Steenson kicked a penalty before a whirlwind spell of four tries in 14 minutes left the visitors reeling.
First Exeter were allowed to take a line-out unopposed and Australia lock Mumm broke away from the back of a ruck to cruise through a gaping hole for his fourth try of the season.
We had to make 100 tackles and we missed 20 and that is not good enough at this level
The Blues were unable to contain the pace and verve of Exeter's attack, and after Dollman's break, right wing Jess exploited a splintered defence and more weak tackling for the third try.
Tonga international Vainikolo, making his first competitive start for Exeter, stepped inside four defenders to score the fourth.
Flanker White, discarded by the Blues two years ago, could scarcely conceal his delight as he dived over with barely a hand laid on him for the fifth.
Steenson's first conversion came back off an upright, but he landed his next four with aplomb as the Chiefs established a 36-3 half-time cushion.
The only downside was seeing try-scorer Johnson limp off, but they barely missed a beat initially.
Steenson's neat dummy and dart saw Whitten cross for the sixth try 12 minutes into the second half.
As Steenson's conversion came back off an upright for a second time, Wales and Lions wing Cuthbert took a frustrated kick at the rebounding ball and proceeded to fall over, neatly encapsulating the Blues' humiliation.
But as Exeter, perhaps inevitably, stepped off the gas, the Blues rallied with two tries in four minutes, scrum-half Williams scampering over and replacement back-rower Copeland bounding through another big hole.
Halfpenny converted both and suddenly there was further cause for optimism as Exeter were reduced to 13 men inside a minute, with Whitten - for a deliberate knock-on - and replacement Sireli Naqelevuki, for a high tackle on Robinson, sent to the sin-bin.
The Blues exploited their numerical advantage as Cuthbert crossed in the right corner and Robinson darted over on the opposite flank.
They created two further chances to increase anxiety in the home ranks but Exeter composed themselves to finish the job.
Exeter head coach Rob Baxter:
""In the first half we played with real intent and the attitude that we took on to the pitch following last week was absolutely fantastic - not just to attack the game but also the physicality and strength of the carries.
""Obviously the battle for us is to keep the quality for longer periods. When you go down to 13 men you put yourself under a bit of pressure and we got ourselves down to 13 pretty unnecessarily. That flipped the whole game.""
Blues director of rugby Phil Davies:
""We didn't do anything that we said we would do inthe first half, particularly for our kicking game, and that gave them too many opportunities to come back at us.
""I think we had to make 100 tackles and we missed 20 and that is not good enough at this level.
""We have to give Exeter credit for the way that they played but we had far more control on the game in the second half. To get four tries was pleasing to give us some momentum going into next week.""

The fine comes just months after Taiwanese firm AU Optronics was found guilty on similar charges.
Toshiba has denied the charges and said it will take necessary legal action to overturn the verdict.
""While Toshiba appreciates the jury's time and effort, Toshiba believes that the jury's verdict is in error as to the finding of wrongdoing,"" the firm said.
LCD panels are used in a variety of products, ranging from flat screen TVs to personal computers and laptops.
However, some of the world's leading manufacturers of these panels, including Samsung and LG Electronics, were accused of colluding to keep their prices high in a bid to boost profits.

Cooper then missed what looked a straightforward penalty, but Australia were soon back in front through their first try, from Cummins in the 17th minute.
The left wing cut in to expose weakness in the home defence after a midfield break from hooker Stephen Moore.
The Irish line was breached again on 24 minutes as Hooper accepted Scott Fardy's back-handed offload for an easy run-in.
Cooper's miss from the conversion was little comfort to a clearly stunned Irish side.
Schmidt's charges did whittle away at the deficit through Sexton's penalties, and open-side Hooper was sin-binned for not rolling away, but the reality was that Ireland had rarely threatened the Australian line.
Cooper crossed for a try six minutes after the restart as confusion between Luke Marshall and replacement fly-half Ian Madigan presented the the Aussie number 10 with a gap.
And another Cooper penalty extended the visitors' lead to 25-15, Madigan claiming three back with a penalty.
Hooper scored his second try as Australian barged over after a line-out, with Cooper's conversion making it 32-15.
Even when they thought they had grabbed a late consolation try, Ireland were to be confounded - penalised for a knock-on in the build-up as replacement Sean Cronin touched down.

These include secretive behaviour, or a tendency always to be buying the latest ""must-have"" item.
There can also be physical and emotional symptoms that they are in trouble, the Money Advice Service said.
Signs to watch out for include:
The Money Advice Service (MAS) - which is backed by the government- says that getting debt advice can make a big difference to people's lives.
One study suggested that within 3 months of receiving advice, 65% of participants were either repaying their debts, or had cleared them in full.
""Free debt advice is available now and will help support you in getting your finances back on track before your money worries become a bigger issue,"" said Sheila Wheeler, director of debt advice at the MAS.

994,"To look at the stats you wouldn't think so: Apple has two million of them in its App Store and Google Play has a few hundred thousand more than that. Total app downloads have passed the 150 billion mark.
But some are wondering whether apps are about to be replaced by something smaller, smarter and faster.
Bots.
These programs, thanks to AI [artificial intelligence] software in the cloud, can chat to humans via text, extract the meaning and then act on it.
They are little digital helpers.
Any time you see a live chat box open up on a retailer's website, or order a taxi or flowers through chat platforms such as WeChat and Facebook Messenger, you're most likely talking to a bot.
Despite the vast choice of apps open to us, the average number we use is 27, according to research by Nielsen. This hasn't changed for years.
And the problem with apps - and their seemingly endless updates - is that they eat up our smartphone storage capacity alarmingly quickly.
Developers often get a raw deal as well. One estimate suggests that 94% of the cash generated by apps in Apple's App Store goes to just 1% of publishers, and those firms also get 70% of all downloads.
""One of the worst things about the App Store is the App Store itself, because it's such a walled garden,"" says Ted Nash of Tapdaq, who was a veteran app developer while still a teenager.
Apple's oversight of all apps slows down development and forces programmers to include specific chunks of code that look after adverts, usage statistics and other metrics, he says.
Add to this the trouble of making apps work across lots of different devices and keeping up with changes to Apple software, and it's no wonder some people are disillusioned, he says.
So is app fatigue setting in?
""Apps used to be the big thing,"" says Kriti Sharma, head of mobile development at accounting software firm Sage. ""But many more people are messaging than are posting on social media these days.""
This is why she thinks bots are the natural successors to apps - the interface is instantly familiar to customers.
Ms Sharma started her coding career at Barclays, where she co-created its Pingit banking app and oversaw its mobile portfolio.
For companies or brands that want meaningful interaction with customers, a conversation mediated by a bot could work well, she believes.
Sage is developing a bot called Pegg that acts as a smart business assistant. It will help small business owners keep track of outgoings and expenses, making tracking cashflow easier.
""Bots don't have to be super-complicated,"" says Ms Sharma. ""But over time they must add a lot more value for a customer.""
Bots are more credible because good progress has been made in writing artificially intelligent software, she says. And also because many companies now have huge amounts of data they can use to fine-tune bot responses.
Another advantage bots have over apps is the speed with which they can be developed, deployed and updated, she argues.
This growing interest is being inflated by work at Facebook, Microsoft and Google, as well as by newer firms such as Slack and HipChat. And start-ups such as Begin, Growbot, Butter, Wisdom and Operator are also helping to take bots mainstream.
One catalyst for the interest was Facebook's announcement earlier this year of a bot framework that streamlines the bot-creation process.
One report suggests that this massive amount of interest has unleashed a $4bn (Â£3bn) flood of venture capital funding into big and small bot developers.
""Bots are the new black,"" says Jon Moore, chief product officer at rail ticket booking service, The Trainline.
Although most people now use The Trainline via a smartphone and many regular users have installed its app, the company is keen to investigate what bots can do, Mr Moore says.
For booking train tickets, a website or an app is profoundly better than using a bot, he maintains, but there are times when an app falls short and a conversation handled by a bot may be better.
""We're just at the point of saying it's another interesting piece of technology,"" he tells the BBC. ""We expect that they are going to be useful to us, though it won't work for every context and circumstance.""
Tapdaq's Ted Nash warns that though bots might look straightforward, they're not necessarily an easier option.
""A bot is a much more simple technology from a customer perspective, but the AI that powers it is immensely complicated to do,"" he says.
That difficulty often means that bots are pretty crude.
""A lot of them now have pre-defined inputs and responses,"" says Mr Nash. ""The only way they are going to become truly ubiquitous is when they can respond as a human would.""
But even before they do that, says Nick Lane, chief analyst at consultancy MobileSquared, bots are likely to be useful for smoothing out the interactions between customers and companies.
""We'll see bots helping out with customer engagement, queries and product enquiries,"" he says.
But there is danger in relying too much on a technology still in the early stages of development, he warns.
""Some companies are wondering if they can put their business and reputation in the hands of a computer program.""
There is another reason why technology firms are keen to use text-based chatbots, says Mr Lane.
""It could be that they see this interaction as another form of data mining,"" he says. ""People should ask how that information and conversation is going to be used.
""One way or another there is a model evolving around that communication that will see it being monetised.""

995,"New York Judge Thomas Griesa said the plan was ""lawless"".
However, he stopped short of finding the country in contempt of court.
Argentina was trying to get around an earlier court ruling banning it from paying interest to investors who had accepted restructured bonds.
Mr Griesa ruled in July that the country must first pay the hedge funds holding out for full payment on the bonds on which it defaulted in 2001.
""I want to be very clear, this proposal is a violation of the current orders of this court... it is illegal and the court directs that it cannot be carried out,"" Mr Griesa said on Thursday.
The hedge funds, which bought Argentina's bonds at a big discount after its economic meltdown and previous default in 2001-02, are owed an estimated $1.3bn (Â£766m).
Argentina has consistently refused to pay them, saying it cannot afford to do so, and called them ""vultures"" for refusing to swap their bonds for lesser valued ones.
Mr Griesa likened Argentina's stance to a man showing up to complete a house purchase with only $80,000 to buy a $100,000 property and insisting: ""$80,000 is a lot of money and my family is ready to move in"".
""He would be laughed out of the neighbourhood,"" the judge added.
On Thursday, Mr Griesa urged the two sides to try and find a compromise.
""If we can have a process leading to settlement, that is the path that  should be taken,"" the judge said.
In July, Argentina's Economy Minister Axel Kicillof flew to New York to try to make a deal with the hedge funds.
However, the talks broke down, forcing Argentina to default on its debt - its second default in 13 years - thus exacerbating problems in its recession-hit economy.","Argentina's plan to exit its debt default by asking investors holding defaulted bonds to swap them for new locally issued debt has been ruled ""illegal"" by a US court.",28891208

Defence advocate Sarah Livingstone said the father of two had been holding the drugs for others and he had no idea of the value or purity.
At the High Court in Glasgow, he was remanded in custody pending sentence.
Prosecutor Keith O'Mahony said: ""He was employed as a sales manager for the Arnold Clark motor group, but lost his job as a result of this case.""

999,"There will be no announcement before the Senate returns on 22 February, said deputy press secretary Eric Schultz.
Republicans have demanded President Barack Obama - a Democrat - leave the nomination to his successor next year.
Mr Scalia, 79, was found dead at a Texas ranch on Saturday. He died of natural causes, a judge has said.
Presidio County Judge Cinderela Guevara told the Associated Press news agency she came to that conclusion after speaking to Mr Scalia's doctor and the police.
Why is this a big deal?
Scalia - in his own words
The death of a powerful conservative voice on the bench of the country's highest court threatens to spark a constitutional crisis in the US.
According to the constitution, the president nominates justices to the court and the Senate - currently controlled by the Republicans - uses its ""advice and consent"" powers to confirm or reject that person.
In recent years, the court has made key rulings on gay marriage, abortion and Mr Obama's key healthcare legislation.
The loss of Mr Scalia means the make-up of the court is now four justices picked by a Democratic president and four by a Republican, so there are four largely liberal voices and four largely conservative.
The conservatives have been in the majority but a new judge could tip the balance, and Republicans running for president are strongly opposed to Mr Obama making his choice.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell agrees - he believes such a key appointment should not be made by a departing president.
But the White House has vowed to press ahead, although there will be no swift decision within days.
""Given that the Senate is currently in recess, we don't expect the president to rush this through this week, but instead will do so in due time once the Senate returns from their recess,"" said Mr Schultz.
The presidential election is in November, with a new US president to be inaugurated in January 2017.","A new US Supreme Court judge to replace justice Antonin Scalia will be nominated by the president after next week, the White House has said.",35581870
